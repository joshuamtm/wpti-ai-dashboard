      It's going to have a synopsis, it's going to have recordings, et cetera.    So you use that, and then that way you're not so preoccupied taking notes, and by extension, let's be honest, checking emails, that kind of stuff, because it's inevitable when you have a screen in front of you.    So this will allow you to really be present with us today, so I encourage you to do that.    You will need your computers, and so it's good that there's a little bit of charging space here, you know, give each other, sort of take turns if there isn't room for everyone.    But you won't need to be using your computer throughout the session, so it shouldn't lose power, unless you have an old computer like I used to.    But anyway, I do want to pass it over to Josh.    I will be just checking folks in later.    It's a big group, and it's on the second session.    I don't remember everyone's name.    So if you could just, during the break, stop by to tell me I'm going to sign you in.    I want to make sure that have.    It's okay.    Anything else, Josh, about the health, Stephen?    I'll do it.    We will be having lunch again today.    The lunch should arrive around noon, possibly a little bit later, but we'll feed you at this time, I promise.    We're going to have enough food.    So I will let Josh take over from here.    Thanks again for being here, and I look forward to learning alongside you.    Hi, everyone.    All right.    I'm going to be standing over here today.    Kim is in Arizona, but is joining us here via Zoom, and it's nice that we do have this new room and everything.    Again, we'll have a transcript, but it actually worked out really well last time.    So we have a whole synopsis and everything, as we promised, for anyone who either missed it or just wanted to review it.    And I wanted to start by sharing something I shared in the community.    A quick question.    You can give a show of hands.    How many of you successfully signed into Circus?    to our community there.    Quick show of hands.    Almost everybody.    That's awesome.    Okay.    And how many of you then saw the post that I put up of this dashboard for our group?    A lot of you.    Great.    Okay.    Is that helpful information for folks that have?    Yeah.    Okay.    And welcome.    Any and all feedback.    I can certainly try to get more information there.    I'm just going to give you a quick list of things.    So the synopsis is right here.    This covers basically everything we talked about in the first session.    And I will continue to create synopses for each session as we go.    And have them there.    I'll keep redesigning the dashboard as we have more data to put in it.    There are right now kind of fundamentally three views in the upper right-hand corner.    have the learner view.    You have the executive view, which is more for kind of myself, Kim, have owner for    Justin and Andrea, but you're all welcome to kind of look at it and sort of think about how we're doing that.    And then I added something because it was kind of fun.    So we were talking, where's Carlton at?    There you go.    Carlton was talking last week about making podcasts with Notebook LM and there were two different papers that came out over the past few months around kind of return on investment that businesses, not non-profit specifically, but businesses are seeing or not seeing from artificial intelligence implementations.    One that got a lot of buzz was the MIT paper that came out a few months ago that kind of was that 95% of AI projects, according to the companies, are failing, meaning they're not producing measurable ROI for them.    This created a lot of buzz, a lot of AI bubble talk, and all that kind of stuff.    Then the Wharton School came out with a paper just last week that said...    And 75% of them are succeeding.    And so this is interesting.    So I thought, well, yes.    Is that because the program went there?    I don't know.    He would have made them succeed.    I don't know.    I don't know the answer to that.    So I thought this is a good opportunity to think.    One, kind of use some of the skills that we were talking about in session, one, to synthesize these Q reports and sort of compare them and sort of see why do we have this discrepancy.    And then Carlton kind of inspired me.    said, why don't I use the debate feature of Notebook L.M.    and have the two hosts of the debate debate this ROI thing.    Like, is there, are we actually seeing benefits?    So that is here.    I don't know if the sound's going to work here.    Let's see.    Today we're diving into one of the most intellectually.    So you can listen to that right there.    And if you want to explore some of the insights that my little analysis produced about this, I thought that would be interesting.    And I tried to even relate it to the WPTI and everything like that.    Yeah, where's the link for this?    The link for this is in Circle.    But if you want to just, if you can see the little URL of Sarah, you're certainly welcome to take a screenshot of that and go to it.    Yeah, but in the Circle community.    If not, we can certainly make sure we have it available for you.    it in Circle?    I want that.    In Circle, I think I put it, where did I put it in Circle?  
  00:05:21 \- Kim Snyder  
      I think you put it in Session 2 updates.  
  00:05:24 \- Classroom 520  
      Session 2 updates?    Okay.    Let's take a look real quick and then I'll show you.    Yeah, in Resources.    Okay, so it's in the Resources section.    Scroll down.    I posted this thing yesterday about Google Blue Sites for Gemini and Noble LM.    They have the 57, 10-minute little learning bite that you can learn, although it's focused on marketing.    comment.    on.    I didn't But then the second post down right now is that cohort report and insights dashboard.    I just want everybody to be aware of that and know that I'll continue to make those as we go.    And if anyone has feedback or things you'd like to see in that dashboard specifically, let us know.    I can't promise I will do it, but I will do my best, okay?    Okay.    And one of the skills that we're using to create a lot of the data visualizations and insights that you're seeing there is one of the skills we're going to talk about and teach you and have you practice on today.    All right.    So everybody can look forward to that.    All right.    So we covered the dashboard very quickly.    So today we're going to talk about human plus AI augmentation.    Fundamentally, what I think we're trying to do is amplify our own effort to produce more output and better outcome without having to increase the amount of effort that we've...    Put out, right?    that, you know, ultimately, can we produce more of the output and outcomes that we want without having to put more hours and time and effort into it?    Fundamentally, that's we're trying to do.    Human plus AI augmentation is the best way we're going to achieve that.    We're going to talk about workflow planning, and we'll get into that a little bit.    AI packages, deep research, exploratory data analysis, which is what I was talking about, about how you get these data visualizations and things from AI, and then applying our compass framework.    Kim, feel free to jump in at any point.    My assumption, Kim, is that today, I'm going to be sort of leading it, and you'll chime in where you want.    There's no sections that you're leading.  
  00:07:44 \- Kim Snyder  
      Is that right?    There's no sections I'm leading, though I do have, like, demos for the exploratory data analysis prompt, and I'm happy to run anything here if you want me to share my screen that anyone, that would like.  
  00:07:59 \- Classroom 520  
      Okay.    Thank you.    And can everybody hear, Kim, okay?    Yeah.    Too loud or the volume is good?    It's good.    All right.    So I just talked about this, the idea of doing more of what matters, kind of reaching more people, elevating our work.    So let's take a quick look at kind of anything.    All right.    So let's take a look at what we're looking at here.    So this is, where is this framework from, by the way, Kim?  
  00:08:25 \- Kim Snyder  
      We didn't make this, right?    It's Stanford.  
  00:08:27 \- Classroom 520  
      No, this is Stanford.  
  00:08:28 \- Kim Snyder  
      Stanford.    Okay.    Stanford University did a kind of a study when they're thinking about applying AI to work.    And it, yeah.  
  00:08:38 \- Classroom 520  
      Okay.    So there are kind of these levels.    So at age five, right, or whatever we want to call it, it's just human only.    So that this meeting, in a certain sense, is human only.    We are physically here.    We are talking to each other.    It would not make sense to kind of have AI to go up at this for you, right?    However, we're doing a bit of.    Augmentation, who would want to tell me some ways that you can already see we're doing AI augmentation right now in what we're engaging in?    We don't need to take notes because that's happening already for us.    Right.    There's an AI note taker here that's taking a full transcript, so you all don't have to worry about taking notes because you get all the slides.    Every word that's spoken is transcribed and synthesized.    We'll put it on a dashboard afterward.    Perfect.    Any other ways that AI is augmenting what we're doing here?    No right or wrong answers here, by the way.    This is just to think about ways that AI might be augmenting what we're doing today.    One – oh, go ahead.    So, the synthesizing what we're doing.    Synthesizing what we're doing, the dashboard that I showed, yep, right, was created using a lot of AI, the slides, right?    Kim and I both use AI to help us both plan these sessions.    doing of right?    We're lot    Create the slides, right?    So AI is going a lot in the development.    So then you get into kind of equal partnership.    I don't know that I see a huge difference between four and three personally.    It's a bit of a distinction without a difference, in my opinion, not that I would ever question Stanford, a wonderful university, but both of these are like ways we're collaborating with it.    But where we start to go further is where AI is doing things in an automated way with human oversight.    So a great example, in Kim and I's workflow, a lot of our work is meeting with clients around kind of executive technology stuff, governance policies, things like that.    So a typical thing is we meet each week with your organization.    We talk about, you know, what policies need to get created or what projects need to get initiated or move forward.    And then work gets assigned to you, work gets assigned to me, work gets assigned to Kim.    And we need to follow that up with a meeting summary that says,    It hey, here's what we talked about.    Here's the decisions that were made.    Here are the tasks that got assigned, who they were assigned to when it's due.    So Kim and I have like 90% of that automated.    The note taker is in the meeting, and then it gets handed to an AI automation that we use with Zapier that creates this follow-up summary of everything.    And then the oversight is that before it goes out, Kim or I will always review it.    So that summary gets dumped into, depending on which one of us is responsible, our drafts in email, and then we're making sure we human review it before it goes out.    That way you don't get something that's egregiously wrong, right, from our meeting, right?    So I can catch that before it goes out.    So that's an example of H2.    And then H1 is where you're really kind of letting it do its own thing, which is quite powerful in many respects, and I think quite obviously the most dangerous of these things, because now AI is actually taking action.    Actions on our behalf, right, in the world without us having an opportunity to create oversight.    So that's a system that you would want to have a means of monitoring.    Any questions about this?    I saw slightly confused basis.    The person we report to see for the discovery of AI within the last two months, and we're now getting a lot of more detailed instructions.    And also the feedback on our responses is also more detailed.    Yes.    So that person is probably doing H4 and H3 with the things that you're working on, right?    Okay.    So these are kind of levels to think about.    And in session one, we were mostly focused here.    But as we go through the course, we're going to start exploring these kind of things further down the line.    Okay.    All right.    So where do these things fail?    Anyone have any suggestions of ways this, these kinds    All kinds of automations can fail?    Yeah.    If you don't understand the limitations of the AI, whatever judgment you make after it produces something, you don't understand how it was made, what its likely errors are, you're not going to be able to interact very well with it.    Correct.    So a good example would be if I asked AI to produce a scientific paper on quantum mechanics, I would have no idea whether that's accurate or not, and no way of validating whether the algorithm is there.    So that would be, if I had published that, it's like, hey, I have a paper on quantum mechanics, that's great insight.    I could be a laughingstock or I could win a Nobel Prize.    don't know.    But, all right, other examples?    Well, sometimes the screening is too narrow.    In other words, I remember my daughter was applying for a job at the University of Wisconsin, and basically it was being read by automated things.    You know, she didn't understand if the job description says we want someone who's always on time and her resume said I'm never late.    It didn't pick her up.    Yep.    And so they were screening out.    They weren't, yeah, they weren't letting good candidates pass through the system.    Did I talk last week about the lacrosse players named Jared?    Did I do that?    Yeah.    So that's like an example of that, right?    Yeah.    And so, yeah, there are lots of, lots of ways that I think this stuff can go wrong.    And the way that we try to prevent that is, number one.    You're thinking of jokes.    Pardon?    No, no.    Oh, okay.    Is being aware of these things, right?    I was just doing a session yesterday on bias in AI systems and kind of saying, like, you know, humans are biased creatures, right?    I know from research that if I am screening candidates and doing interviews, that I am going to be biased.    Bias toward people that look like me and are like me, so have a similar background, you know, or like New York, you know, kids and, you know, whatever.    And so if I don't have awareness of that, then I may wind up hiring a bunch of people that look and act like me, which is not going to be optimal for the world and not for my organization as well.    But if I have awareness that that bias exists and acknowledge it and then set up ways to try to mitigate that bias, I have a better chance of managing exactly the same kind of thing with AI.    And then, of course, reviewing it and having other perspectives.    Okay.    All right.    So much of our work is in this kind of augmentation and partnership with AI.    And we are going to try to get, you know, before we get to the end of these four sessions, into those higher levels of two and one where we're starting to do more automation.    But most of what we're going to be doing is this augmentation and partnership.    All right.    There's a lot going on in this slide, so let's explain this.    So the things in blue, if we think about a meeting, which was sort of the workflow that I talked about before, all right, and this is, there's two things I want people to start paying attention to on this slide.    One is where it's human-only, where it's human and AI working together, and where it's just AI, okay?    And so the blue is human-only, orange and blue is both, and then orange-only is AI-only.    The second thing that I want you to pay attention to, because we're going to start working on this in the session today, is the idea of this as a workflow, okay, that has a kind of beginning and an end.    And when we think about how to implement AI in our organizations, the most effective and easiest way to think about it is to break your work into workflows that have.    So these kind of beginnings and ends, and then the end is some output that happens, okay?    And then you can break that down and say, okay, well, we need to set up a meeting.    The humans need to do that.    To decide to have this class, a human needs to do that, right?    That's going to be human-only.    We're having the meeting.    The humans need to be at the meeting, at least for now, okay?    But now, look, we're going to have a transcript here, and that's going to do action item extraction, where, and I'll drive our little automation.    So Kim and I use a tool called Fathom, and we learned about a year ago that this video tool called Fathom actually creates a data field when I say the word action item.    So if I say action item, Kim, please review the transcript of this meeting.    That actually triggers and gets dumped into our project management platform, which is Asana.    So as soon as this meeting ends, Kim is now going to have that action item in her Asana because...    I use that kind of trigger phrase, right?    So that's where this human AI kind of working together can happen.    And as you start to use these AI note-takers, you can make them a lot more effective by learning actually how to talk to them in a meeting, right?    And what's kind of funny, this is just an insight that I've had, is it really supports active listening, which is kind of a good skill anyway.    So let me demonstrate active listening.    Just make a point of any kind.    Like just, you know, say anything.    really doesn't matter what.    Yesterday I was listening to the use of AI to avoid BIOS while reviewing resumes.    Okay.    And remind me of your name again?    Julissa.    Julissa.    Julissa.    Okay.    So, Julissa, what I heard you say, okay, is that yesterday you were reviewing resumes and thinking about how AI may have bias when it's reviewing those resumes.    And that's something you're...    Yes?    Okay.    So by that, that's what I kind of mean by active listening.    You're validating that what you've heard from the person was accurate and that the action or whatever we wanted to do next was accurate.    And by doing that, you're making it also clear to the AI when it needs to go and summarize the meeting exactly what it was you agreed on, which will reduce the amount of errors that happens there.    And I would argue is a pretty good human behavior to do this kind of active listening and validating of people and demonstrate that you're listening to them and understanding actually what they said.    So that's all these things.    Then we review it.    Maybe we draft an agenda for our next meeting based on the previous one.    Tim and I do this in automation all the time.    The transcript happens automatically.    The summary happens automatically.    Now, emailing it out, is that going to happen AI only?    No.    We're going to review that, right?    Okay.    And then task automation, as I mentioned, that task is going to be automated into a project management tool for Kim.    Already.    Okay, so two things to think about here.    One, there's this workflow of a meeting, which I think is a workflow we're all pretty familiar with.    And then the second piece is all the different components of where it's human-only, where it's human-plus AI, and where you can automate it entirely.    And when you start breaking out the work that happens in your organization into these workflows and understanding it this way, implementing AI becomes much clearer, right?    Where you can do it, where you can do it with human, where you can't at all, and all those things.    Does that make sense to everybody?    Yes, it does.    Okay, awesome.    Great.    All right, so we're going to do a little brainstorming session.    Kim, is this where we already have the prompt for them?    Are we doing this on Post-its?  
  00:20:50 \- Kim Snyder  
      That is the prompt.    Oh, no, that's not the prompt.    The prompt is coming.    But this is where, this is the Post-it notes.    Okay.    Okay.    So take a couple, if you go back.  
  00:21:03 \- Classroom 520  
      Yeah.  
  00:21:04 \- Kim Snyder  
      Okay.    this is just.  
  00:21:08 \- Classroom 520  
      Back one more?  
  00:21:09 \- Kim Snyder  
      No.    Where, where, where, sorry.  
  00:21:16 \- Classroom 520  
      We're on brainstorming.    Types of workflows that are in your work lives are candidates for AI.  
  00:21:21 \- Kim Snyder  
      Yes.    Okay.    So the brainstorm.    Yes, that one.    Okay.    Um, so this is, uh, this, this is, uh, instead of doing a mentee, cause, uh, it's just more effective, I think, uh, sometimes just to do it when you're, everyone gets to be in person and post-it notes.    So this is one of the post-it notes things.    So this is take 10 minutes.    Okay.    Um, to kind of think about workflows.    So you just heard about the note-taking workflow that we have.    So if you think about workflows in your own day, okay, like stuff you do and they don't have to be perfect and thought out and you don't have to have a broken down.    Like we just did on that, you know, in that slide, but if you think about workflows, start to identify some potential candidates.    There's a reason we're doing this.    Like things that you do in your daily work life that might lend themselves to some augmentation, if not wholly, probably not entirely, but then partially certain steps.    So this is just a take 10 minutes, brainstorm, and then it'd be great if those stickies could go somewhere, like on one of the easel board pages.  
  00:22:38 \- Classroom 520  
      Yeah, yeah, we can do that.    I'll take care of that, Justin.    That's okay.    So let me, let's do it like this.    Let me, I'll give an example, just so we can kind of think about it.    And I'll try to, I'll try to do one that I think we could all relate to in this step.    So an example of a workflow to an organization, we described a meeting workflow.    Okay, another one might be an    So the start of an intake is person fills out web form, and that is the kind of kickoff of this process.    So then they need to get qualified.    And so maybe there's some information we need from them to determine if they're eligible for our program.    Right.    And that happens in an intake.    Okay.    So then that goes on to meeting with a counselor.    So a meeting needs to get scheduled with a counselor.    Right.    So we get paired with counselor.    All right.    Then we come over here and we meet with counselor.    Okay.    Okay.    so on.    Okay.    Until we decide what is the end of that process, which is the person is enrolled.    Great.    Great.    Great.    Okay, and if there's any, like, you know, Six Sigma people here that are like, please use the diamonds and the things, then I'm sorry, I'm just not, I just can't, all right?    So, but my apologies to you in advance, all right?    So, and then this is sort of where this process ends, okay?    And there might be more steps in it that you would think of.    And so, once you have the process broken down, this workflow, now we can start to say, okay, could this qualification, how do we currently do that?    Well, the person fills out a big PDF form that's really annoying to them.    They don't do it for a week and then they handwrite it and they mail it to us and read it.    So, maybe we could create, like, a chatbot that just asks them all the questions in their own language and now we would get that information much more reliably and it would be accurate, right?    So, you can start to brainstorm where we could use AI to improve particular...    particular parts of the workflow, just like we did in this meeting idea, right?    So you're thinking about where does it have to be human?    Obviously, the human has to initiate the process.    That has to be a human-only thing, right?    But the meeting with the counselor, mostly a human thing, but maybe there's AI augmentation when we have a transcript that's there.    Maybe the counselor has a script that they're working from or something that's helping them, right?    Maybe we coach them with like a role-play bot that helps the counselor do better when they get to these sessions.    There's a whole bunch of things you can do.    So other workflows that I can think of that may occur in your organizations, right, other than intakes, would be like sessions, courses that you offer.    So people in your organizations, your clients enroll in a course for job coaching, they attend it, they complete it, they get a grade, they get a certification.    Certificate.    They get referrals out to other things, right?    So that might be another workflow.    you think about how to break it down.    Does anyone want to think of, like, just tell me, well, let me ask it this way.    Does anyone feel like they're still not sure if I give you 10 minutes to pick a workflow in your organization and write each phase on a Post-it and just lay them out on your table, okay?    So you've got 10 minutes to do that.    Does anyone feel like, I have no idea how I would do that right now?    It's okay.    Raise your hand if you don't know, if you haven't, like, I just don't know what workflow I would do.  
  00:26:37 \- Kim Snyder  
      offer up something here, Josh.  
  00:26:39 \- Classroom 520  
      Yeah, go ahead.  
  00:26:40 \- Kim Snyder  
      Even if you can't break it down, we have an app that's going to help you chunk through your workflow in a couple slides.    So I'm just going to kind of give you that little hint here.    So it's not, this is more around just starting to think about what are the types of jobs.    That I could partner with AI on, on some level, okay?    So, you know, and what, this is just starting to think about different types of jobs that you have, so that you can start to think about, huh, how can AI work here?    And we actually have a prompt and an app that can help you think that through.    And so those are things that you will have.    Like, you don't have to have thought out the whole thing and like, oh, God, what part of it would I hand off to AI and, oh, I have to remember to say action item.    It's not at that level.    It's more a higher level.    What are the types of jobs and tasks that you do in your daily life and really thinking about those ones that take up, they take up time and are repetitive and we can start to look at them.    They're worth breaking down into steps.    Does that help a little?

      Yeah.    Looks like most of you get to go.    So we're going to go, put up a timer, and we'll give you a new job development.    All right?    And then if you need help, raise your hand, and I will be happy to come help you out.    That's okay, man.    I'll just automate that.    Yeah, right.    That's basically what she said.    That's basically that example.    Yeah, yeah, yeah.    That breaks it down into, you know, Yeah, so with the, With the, My family..    yeah.    yeah.    Yeah.    family..    Yeah.    We'll see you next time.    Fathom, Fathom, Fathom, Fathom.    Person who has a completed workflow, if you can raise your hand and let me know, because I'm going to ask you for a follow-up, okay?    Once you've completed one workflow.    I know we're tight here as always, but if you want to put your workflow up on the posted board on the back, all right?    You've got a workflow, please?    Over there?    Great, okay.    Thank you.    Fathom, Fathom, Fathom, Fathom.    Fathom, Fathom.    Thank you.    So that's my email.    I can take your email down so that when...    So that's your email, so what, oh man, okay, yeah, I'll remember, I'll connect with my phone.    I said they showed up, said they showed up.    I said they showed up.    Thank you very much.    Thank you.    All right, you got one minute left, everybody.    One minute left.    Refresh the screen.  
  00:35:42 \- Kim Snyder  
      Refresh the screen.  
  00:35:44 \- Classroom 520  
      Refresh the screen, okay.    This is time.    You want to tap up, then, and on.    Okay.    For the next phase, I have a volunteer.    Thank you, by the way, my volunteers who are going to do this with us.    However, this is a play-along if you would like to, okay?    But I can't give tech support to everybody.    So play-along.    Whoa, our Post-its are falling off.    That's too bad.    All right, it's rating Post-its.    So you have two options, okay?    Number one, if you have a free or work GPT account, I recommend you use the GPT link here.    So you can go to that URL, you can scan the QR code.    You're going to want to do this on your computer, probably, because that will be easier, so you can get your computer out.    You're going to want to do this with your workflow, but if you want to do it with the workflow we're going to demo for everybody, that's fine, too.    And then you can do your own on your own time.    If you don't have access to a chat GPT account,    free or paid, then you can use the prompt, and you'll copy and paste the prompt into Copilot or Gemini or Claude, whatever it is you are using, and then follow along from there, and that should work.    You do not have to follow along, you can just watch our demo, but if you would like to try this while we're doing it and get your own output, this is an opportunity to do that because this will be about 10 minutes while we go through this, okay?    So, here we go, and we have our volunteers over here, and I am going to jump into the GPT.    All right, so, let's explain how we're going to do this, and I'm going to use my voice.    We're imagining that we're much quicker than we are.    I'm still trying to get my computer up.    Gotcha, gotcha, okay.    Yeah, I can go back, all right, so let's give everybody two minutes to try to get this.    Again, I apologize that I cannot really give everybody, like, full-on tech support for this, okay?    So if you just can't do it, it's okay.    You can do it later on your own time at a break.    I'll try to set you up with it.    It's fine.    You'll get to observe how this works.    You're not going to miss anything critical.    I just wanted to give you an opportunity to do this as well while we're going through it, okay?    And what are my two folks' names over here, by the way?    Three of us.    three of you.    Yeah.    My name is Michael.    Michael?    Inos.    Inos?    Yep.    Inos.    And Pari, K-A-R-I.    Pari.    yeah.    Michael, Pari, and Ino.    Ino.    Ino.    Okay.    Ino.    Ino.    Ino.    Ino.    Pari.    Okay.    All right.    You were ready about 34 seconds.    Can we proceed?    Excellent.    Okay.    I will get Allison's here.    No, I love Yeah.    That's fellow.    You call me that yesterday.    That's working.    My mom's name would be that.    Can I ask, is this an agent?    People who recognize it are never able.    People who don't recognize it, not recognize it, not work that out of the way.    All right.    Here we go.    All right.    So we've got our wonderful volunteers, Michael, Enos, and Kari.    So let's start by saying, tell me what this workflow is in a sentence or two.    We administer older adult workforce homework.    So, with this process, we want to use AI to assist in the streaming process of applicants.    Okay, what I would like is just a description of what the workflow is.    So, the first phase would be the complete application.    Okay.    And then the second phase would be the collection of documents.    Okay, well, let me describe.    So, this is for a workforce development organization, the workflow is screening from intake through enrollment or rejection.    Is that accurate?    Correct.    Perfect.    Okay.    For a workforce development organization, an intake process from the application through to screening and decision as to whether the applicant is enrolled in the program or not.    Okay.    Okay.    So, it's...    Now we're going to ask us questions, all right, about this intake process and what is going to happen at the conclusion of this is it's going to create basically like a workflow for you and then suggest ways that you can improve it using AI or even just traditional process improvements.    You can see it's asking you lots of questions, okay?    And I'm going to give it one thing about when you use these prompts that we give you or other prompts that you make or download, don't, if you see that it's like asking me like 10 questions all at the same time, just say, please ask me one question at a time.    Cool.    You don't have to be a, you know, like a, don't just follow the AI, like redirect it, okay?    What is the main goal of this intake process?    We include appropriate candidates so that we can assist them to secure it.    To recruit them or to select them?    To select them.    Okay.    So, repeat that.    Select appropriate candidates for us to assist them in securing employment.    Okay.    From a pool of applicants, select appropriate candidates so that we can place them successfully with employment.    All right.    The next question, whose data is collected and reviewed during this process and does it include any PII or sensitive information like names, details, etc.?    In the application, there is PII information, PII, of course.    And it's the applicant's information.    Okay.    Yes.    And it is the applicant's information.    And yes, it includes sensitive information like their names and contact details.    All right.    So, for those of you, if you're following along, you can do .    Exactly what I'm doing.    Okay.    And do their workflow and just see what your version of it does.    But if you just map your workflow and you want to do your workflow along with me, do that as well.    Okay.    And you can tune out and kind of follow along yourself.    That's fine.    Or you can follow along with Michael and Enos and Tari.    Okay.    All right.    So now it's saying this is helpful.    Okay.    Okay.    What tools or systems does your organization currently use to handle applications, screening, and enrollment decisions?    Microsoft Form.    Okay.    I mean, we usually have like a form that we fill out.    Oh, yeah.    It's Microsoft.    But that's usually out.    So the applicant.    So I apply.    I fill out a Microsoft Form.    When gets dumped into a spreadsheet, then what?    Then the person collects it, reviews the application, and then contacts the person's situation.    When they contact them, when do they do that?    Email?    No.    Telephone.    Telephone.    Telephone.    Okay.    population is above the decline, and email is not there.    Okay, ask the telephone call, what not?    Yeah, yeah, yeah.    Physically?    Physically.    Okay.    All right.    The person, the applicant, submits the application via Microsoft Forms.    The counselor reviews the application and then places a phone call to the applicant who is typically over 55 years old.    The applicant then comes in for an interview and brings in physical documents that they hand over to the counselor who is interviewing.    So sorry, one quick little detail.    Sometimes the applicant needs to come in in person and fill out the form.    right.    Thank you.    In-person.    Not necessarily.    Yeah, because a lot of them are not tech savvy, so filling out a Microsoft form on a computer may be challenging for them, so we'll have an in-person staff member to help them fill out the application.    So that's not always a form.    This is a great opportunity.    Okay, this is great information.    If anyone's following along with how I'm thinking, just to go.    So they say...    Yeah, were talking about having the information done verbally, and then it'd be recorded instantly.    Exactly, right?    So that's an opportunity to just have the person transcribe And then a non-text savvy person can do it over the phone.    Exactly.    Okay.    Some of the applicants are not tech savvy enough to complete the Microsoft form, so they actually come in and are helped by a counselor to complete a physical form on paper.    He's doing a great job.    And so that right there strikes me as a great opportunity for, we can make that process more efficient, probably more accurate with AI, without really reducing any of the human quality.    Okay, does your organization currently use any AI platforms or assistants, such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Co-Pilot, Gemini, or others?    No, not the organization.    Us, ourselves, by ourselves, and our personal ChatGPTs, but never.    But the organization does not use any.    Okay, you have access to them.    You don't have access to Compilot.    How are you using it now?    Sorry, we use our personal ChatGPT accounts.    We don't know enterprise that we are.    So your organization is on Microsoft 365, but they haven't given you access to Co-Pilot?    I guess we do have access to Co-Pilot.    But it's only access.    They haven't, you're not using it yet.    Yeah, we're not using it.    We do not have any official access to these tools.    We think that Co-Pilot is available in our environment, but we have not been training on it yet.    And many people have been using personal ChatGPT accounts.    Yeah, everybody following along so far?    yeah, And so...    Taking your time to kind of do this with this GPT will help you get a good output for you, and then will give you some really clear suggestions.    They may not be great, you may not be able to implement them, but you'll get ideas.    Is anyone trying to do this on your own while I'm doing this with your own workflow?    Yeah, is it moving ahead?    Are you progressing?    Sort of, yeah.    Oh, the URL, yeah.    Why don't you take a photo of that, or, um, because I do need to get back to the other screen.    Okay.  
  00:47:37 \- Kim Snyder  
      We will have this in the, um, in the community.    And also directions for how to do this, okay?    So, I'll add those in.  
  00:47:48 \- Classroom 520  
      You'll, you'll get that.    No, going to the community after today.  
  00:47:51 \- Kim Snyder  
      We didn't put it in yet.    Yeah, we're going to put them in.  
  00:47:53 \- Classroom 520  
      They'll be there Monday.    Okay.    All right.    Where does this process begin and.    It begins with a complete application, and then it ends with the enrollment decision.    Okay.    The process begins with a completed application.    It ends with a decision as to whether or not to enroll the candidate.    That decision is made by a panel of humans at our organization.    Before the decision is made, there is an interview with the applicant by the panel.    All right.    So, let me check my time.  
  00:48:35 \- Kim Snyder  
      Yeah, we're getting a little behind, but...  
  00:48:37 \- Classroom 520  
      Yeah, I was going to say.    So, what I'm going to do is do something that I often do with these tools.    I'm going to say, I don't wish to answer any more questions right now due to time constraints.    I would like you to make your best assumptions from this point forward and give me a completed workflow and suggestions for AI improvements.    Thank you.    You can always do that with these AIs.    Just say, I'm done.    Just make your best...    assumptions and go, it won't be as good of quality as if I had answered all the questions, right?    Because it didn't get that information from me, okay?    But can you go back to that later?    Yeah, you can always go back to the session and say, I want to update it.    You can take the output it gave you and say, there are some revisions or additional information I want to give you.    You know, it's easy.    One, remember, context is such a critical thing.    In my view, the easiest way to get context from my head to an AI is with my voice.    And I can just grab my voice memo on my phone.    I don't know how many Apple users, iPhone here.    So voice memos, I don't know if you know this, voice memos create transcripts automatically.    They did that from about a year ago.    So you could literally just talk to your voice memo on your phone.    It will create a transcript to understand that to AI.    It's like there's so many easy ways to get this stuff out of your head to the AI so you can understand what you want.    And    Any of those work.    I like the fact that this also tells you what it's assuming.    Yeah.    Which is really good because like that's the kind of thing that could jump out where you're like, oh, this is completely not our program or yeah, we'll work with this.    And so here's what it says.    Each row represents a trigger, what starts the step, what's needed to happen, what actually happens, what comes out of the step, and then pain points.    So it's giving you all of that.    It's telling you how to read the matrix, and then it created an AI opportunity matrix for you.    that, can people read that in the back or you need to zoom that up, okay?    So it's basically saying assist in summarizing the applications, Copilot and Outlook in Excel can condense long applications into key eligibility info, assist with draft call, email notes, assist with document visitation, boom.    You now have your list of here are ways that you could optimize this process and make it a little bit better, a little bit more streamlined with AI and allow you to process more applicants, more effective.    more accurately, make it easier for the applicants, easier for your interviewers, easier for your panel, so on down the line, right?    Okay.    Yes.    Remind me your name again.    Ariana.    Ariana.    Yeah.    So I think you said that like somebody at some point was going to ask this, and so maybe I'm the first one.    Because last time you had given us this, I played around a little bit with what it looked like to actually create a GBT.    But then I was wondering, what's the difference between when it's the best time to create a GBT versus using, create an AI chatbot?    That's not fair, because you're skipping ahead to the next section we're going to do today, which is packages.    Great.    All right.    Well, we're going to talk about exactly that, Ariana.    Okay.    All right.    Never mind.    Yeah.    You're starting to jump ahead.    I get it.    You're ahead of the class.    It's okay.    I was never that person.    I was always kind of in the back, you know, like jive with my friends.    And that's okay.    All right.    In fact, Ariana, look at that.    Literally.    Next slide.    All right.    Thank you to our volunteers for that.    I will, of course, save that for you.    And make sure you get that, so don't worry.    Most of all, that work will not be wasted.    And those of who are playing along, I will ask to bring your attention back.    And you can always pick up that session.    By the way, totally fine to say, can we save this session and come back to it later.    Make sure you name it into Attributee if you're not sure how to do that.    But in the session, you can over on the left where you have the chat itself, Intake Process Review.    So I will rename this Michael and Enos.    And apologies if I'm...    Did I get even close, Enos?    No, you got it.    You got it.    I got it.    Fantastic.    All right.    So there we go.    So that way I'll remember exactly who it's for.    All right.    And that way you can always come back to exactly that thing.    I don't know if anybody knew that, but you can rename your chats by clicking this little ellipse.    To the right of it, and then you can rename it so you can always find it later.    All right.    Back to our slides.    Yeah, packages and projects.    Okay, so to Ariana, would you like to lead this section?    So when do you make it into a GPT, I think?    So GPTs are what we call packages or packages and projects, things like this.    And I'm going to apologize in advance because the AI companies, in this case, the four that we're dealing with primarily in this class, Anthropic, who makes FOD, Microsoft, who makes Copilot, OpenAI, who makes ChatGPT, and Google, who makes Gemini, they've all decided to call them different things, okay?    And none of them function exactly the same way as the other ones, so they're all just slightly different.    So we call them packages.    So the thing that we just shared, that GPT that we worked on with Michael and Enos and...    And Kari is a package.    That's what we're calling it, okay?    And that covers GPTs, gems, agents, which drives me nuts, and projects from CLOT, okay?    So starting from a simple prompt, we covered that.    That's what many of us do, but most of the time that's fine, but you get very basic outputs when you use very basic prompts.    You move into structured prompts, which we talked about last week.    So that's where we taught you craft as a framework.    There are plenty of others, and that's where I make sure that I'm telling it, here's the context, here's the role I want you to play, here's the actions I want you to take, here's what format of output I want, here's the audience that it's for, it's for executives, right?    So that takes more time, okay, but gives you a better output.    So then where we would want to move to a package, okay, is for a couple of reasons.    The first reason, okay, like for me with...    That meta prompt that we shared with you last week, I've made a prompt, a nice, big, long, structured prompt that I want to use a lot.    I'm going to use this five, ten times a day or a few times a week.    And to have to go into a document and find the prompt and copy it and paste it is just kind of annoying.    It's a little bit of friction to my workflow.    So if I can make it into a little shortcut that I click and now I'm immediately there and I don't have to copy-paste the prompt when it's going, that's very useful to me.    So, Ariana, that's the first reason you would convert from to a package, okay?    The second reason is that there might be other assets that I always want to be associated with it.    Okay, so for example, okay, if I am making a resume builder, all right, I might have a prompt that's going to ask the person about the questions to build.    Build a resume.    But I might say I have two documents that are going to be attached as references.    One is what the elements of a good resume should always include.    And I want the package to always have access to this document to reference it.    And then the other one I want to give it is a sample of one really good resume.    And say here is the things that should always be in a good resume.    And here's a sample of a really good resume.    So when I'm interacting with you or a user is interacting with you to help make a resume, you always have these available to you.    So with these packages, most of them will allow you to attach files to them that can be used as references.    Okay, and that can happen in other ways.    Maybe it's a policy chatbot.    So I want the user to be able to ask what are elements of this policy, but I have to have the policy as an attachment so that it knows to reference that.    Okay, that's another reason to make a package.    Third reason to make a package is that I want to be able to share it with other people.    So for Kim, that was the primary reason she wanted to make this workflow into a package because that prompt is annoying for you to all find and copy and paste and put in it, right?    But if you have a GPT account, ChatGPT allows you to share packages publicly, which is pretty handy.    None of the other platforms, I don't believe, do that right now.    Copilot does not let you share it outside of your Microsoft 365 tenant.    I don't think Gemini Gems allow you to share outside.    Go ahead, Kim.  
  00:57:35 \- Kim Snyder  
      They may.    I will research that.  
  00:57:37 \- Classroom 520  
      I think they made some recent changes.    I know they let you share it with other people, which is recent, but I don't think they let you share it outside.    I think ChatGPT is the only one that lets you share, but Kim will verify this for us.    Or anyone else who wants to do a little quick Google sleuthing or any other AI sleuthing.    All right.    So those, Ariana, are the reasons why you would want to turn in a package.    Does that answer your question?    Yes.    Uh, yes, kind of.    Yeah, I don't like the tone of that voice.    All right, so come on.    We're among friends here.    You can tell us why, what your question still is.    Uh, yes.    So I think it does for what to use the GBT for, and that's kind of what I started testing out.    Um, at first I started testing what it would look like to put our policies into a GBT, and then a manager can essentially be like, remind me, like, what the rule is around someone taking PTO, like, what's the max or something.    Um, but the problem I had with it was it kept making up information.    Yep.    And so as I was going through trying to fix that, that's what made me wonder whether a chatbot is more automatically, like, when you give it the policies and stuff, it knows the stick to that more than the GBT does.    You're getting into what I would characterize as a fairly complex aspect of working with AI and large language models, and I will try to...    Explain this as best I can.    So there is a concept known as RAG, or Retrieval Augmented Generation, okay?    And it's a very fancy term.    It's useful to know, just so you know when we're talking about it.    But large language models are trained on this massive trove of data, okay?    And then you provide context that says, here's our policy, and I would like you to answer questions from this policy.    But the problem that these models have in this situation is this probabilistic thing that we talked about last week.    And they have a hard time, even when you give them very clear directions, like don't answer questions except from this document, they really struggle to do that.    And so retrieval augmented generation is the method by which you resolve this.    The only tool I know in the universe.    of stuff that we all have access to that does this nearly perfectly is Notebook LM, which is a Google tool, okay, which is part of the Google workspace.    So if you're Google folks, Notebooks can be shared with other people, and Notebook LM basically is a, like, do-it-yourself retrieval augmented generation system.    All the other ones, if you want a chatbot that absolutely 100% of the time will only answer questions from the data set that you give it, my experience right now is none of these tools do that very well.    They will always stray and get a little creative at times.    And that's just my experience.    Kim, do you have anything that you would disagree with of what I just said?  
  01:00:48 \- Kim Snyder  
      No, I agree, and it's very counterintuitive to people.    It's like, well, I've given it the information, come on.    But it is tricky.    I mean, it can be pretty...    It's good sometimes, but it does go, it does stray or drift.  
  01:01:07 \- Classroom 520  
      I expect we'll start seeing features.    Oh, yeah, go ahead.    Sorry, Kim.    Let me make sure Kim finished.  
  01:01:13 \- Kim Snyder  
      Sorry, Kim, interrupted you.    Yeah, no, it can start to, they will start to drift.    And so that's why it's really important to monitor them over time.    Even if you get one that's working, say, good enough, you want to keep an eye on it because these technologies change.    Also, I want to let you know, you can, in fact, share a Google, a Gemini gem, an aside, with someone else, anyone else with a Google account.  
  01:01:39 \- Classroom 520  
      Oh, cool.    Thank you, Kim.    Carlton.    So I just wanted to give you all context.    So you're right, it's not going to, the tools that we use is not going to be perfect.    And I know that for a fact because I was at this Care Labs event and they were, like, working on these tools and they had to use work agents.    It was, like, one AI tool delegated to two.    different AI tools that allowed them to get specific information.    So it was like they were trying to solve legalities around waste and stuff like that, but they had to get specific information that goes through tools that we not even talk about here because it's like larger models that connect to the other ones.    But they were able to use the chatbots that connect through Slack, but it was a very complex, very complex system.    And I'm still trying to get it.    I wrote notes on it, but I couldn't, you know, I still don't understand it a thousand percent, but yeah, it's a lot more complex system.    It is hard.    And so, yeah, the best I can say around you is that Notebook.lm, if you have access to it, does that really well.    You can share notebooks inside your organization, and then people can query with that and chat with it.    And other than that, you can build these yourself using like vibe coding.    And it's easier than you think, but not super easy.  
  01:03:00 \- Kim Snyder  
      It's easier and harder than you think.    We will be showing Google Notebook, by the way, today in a little bit.  
  01:03:08 \- Classroom 520  
      Yeah.    Okay.    And then the last tier is then automating.    Okay.    And we've talked about that in somewhat.    that automation that I described when I said action item and it creates, Kim's going to have like 9,000 action items from the meeting today.    So they're all going to get assigned to you, Kim.    So action item for Kim, you know, we were talking about Zapier automations and how you can use that to have something happen automatically for you from a trigger.    The trigger in this case is when I say action item in a meeting and then the action that happens is that goes into Zapier, which is like a automation platform that allows us to tie our Fathom transcript, okay, to a large language model that then looks and says, oh, there's an action item here.    What am I supposed to do with it?    Then it says, you're supposed to go put that.    In an Asana project, right, and assign it to whoever the action item was assigned to, the large language model says, that looks like it was Kim, so I'm going to create this Asana task and assign it to Kim, all right, and that's the full automation.    We'll show you what it looks like, and you can set up a free Zapier account, play with these if you want to, and that's kind of fun.    So your ingredient for AI packages are very, very clear instructions.    This almost certainly is going to be a structured prompt, and then if it's appropriate to have supplemental resources that you attach, you would attach those, all right?    What's the difference, all right, between these things?    So the custom AI assistants, ChatGPT, GPTs, GEMS, and Co-Pilot Agents, they contain specialized instructions, they do specific skill steps, and they can be shared.    Projects, which are a little bit different, Claude has them, and ChatGPT    QBT has them.    I think Copilot might have them now as well.    By the way, Copilot also added Notebooks recently.    For any of you in the Microsoft space, you might not see it yet.    They're rolling it out slowly, but they now have Notebooks that work very much like Notebook LM in Google.    So that's a nice addition for the Copilot folks in the audience.    What projects tend to be, you can now share them with other people, they tend to be more personal.    I'll give you an example of a project that I use all the time, is my writing partner.    So I write LinkedIn articles from time to time.    I don't do it very frequently because it's whenever I have something I think I want to write about, and they tend to be pretty long, like several thousand words.    And so I took the 10 articles I've written over the last couple of years that I liked the best, and added those as attachments.    And then I asked ChatGPT to say, start heart, instead goals?    That    Please extract all of the kind of qualities of this writer, right?    Describe the characteristics of this writer, the tone, the style, the aspects of it.    And then I read that and decided, does that sound like what I want my writing to be like?    I made a couple of tweaks, and then that became my instructions for the project.    So then that project has the instructions, write articles like this for this audience, and then it has these kind of attachments of these articles that I like.    And when I want to write a new article, the first thing I do is literally go for a walk, open up this project, and start talking and saying I have an idea for a new article, and I go out for a walk in the woods and have a conversation for an hour, and by the time I come back, I have a draft.    And it's usually still a few hours from anything that I would ever send out in the world, but it's a lot more enjoyable to get to that, you know, two or three thousand word draft that way than sitting at my computer with a blank page and writing it out.    is a great use of a project that works for me personally.    Kim, do you have any other project ideas?    Are there any projects that you use regularly?  
  01:07:10 \- Kim Snyder  
      Yeah, I agree.    I don't necessarily think of it as something that's personal as much as it's something that's ongoing.    For example, I have like a project that I use for developing this curriculum for this class, right?    Because it's ongoing.    It's continuous.    So...    It's subtle.    I'm going to tell you something.    It's subtle.    And, you know, our last...    When we taught a TechSoup course recently, it is one of these things that people could have got like, well, wait, what's the difference?    And it's more about the platform themselves and what you have access to.    It's only for people that are in ChatGPT that you really want to kind of need to wrestle with this one much.    But, you know, you can do similar things in Claude Projects, if that's all you had, that you do in, say, a GPT.    And you can also use GEMS in a similar way, but it won't hold the conversations together.    Actually, it will.    They are, actually, holding the conversations together.  
  01:08:23 \- Classroom 520  
      Yeah, it does have a memory of that, all right?  
  01:08:25 \- Kim Snyder  
      It does have memory.    So it's not that different.    I would say don't get kind of too caught up with the differences, which is, yeah, it's nomenclature.  
  01:08:36 \- Classroom 520  
      Yeah, and these are, again, changing all the time.    So I would really experiment with, again, start from needs that you have.    So my need was I want to write articles periodically, and I would like to make that process a little bit better for myself.    I've tried to make other writing tools.    For the company that I used to work for, we have these very silly cybersecurity videos that we call, I think I actually made like a...    I can show this example, too, like a Tater and Stash writer.    Let me go to my projects again.    I have the, yeah.    So we do these very silly scripts called, let me see the settings, details, details for this.    There's the instructions.    Oh, nothing's happening.    Okay.    We do these very silly cybersecurity awareness abilities called Tater and Stash, so we have to write scripts for them.    And so I've made, like, a script writer that will help me come up with ideas and write draft strips and things like that.    So any sort of repeating workflow that you have that you have to do, these projects can be kind of useful for that.    A quick breakdown across the spectrum of things that we use.    So for the ChatGPT folks, you have GPTs.    You can make them for yourself.    You can make them for others.    The workflow one we just used as an example.    Projects are more where you have a lot more attachments that you want to include in it, and it's an ongoing work.    Another great example for a project is literally a specific.    So both Kim and I will make projects for specific clients we have.    it has for like cybersecurity clients, I'll have their policies, their metrics for securities, and I can use these to basically like answer cybersecurity questionnaires I get, you know, when their cyber liability insurer or their funder says we need you to fill out this 20-page security questionnaire, I can literally just upload it to the project and say, just fill this out for me based on all the information you have, and it will do a lot of that for me, right?    So you can kind of use them in that regard.    So Gemini has gems, very similar idea.    Copilot calls them agents, which drives me nuts, because that's not what agents are, but that's what they call them.    And then Claude has projects.    And Claude doesn't really have an equivalent to gems or GPTs.    They only have the projects right now.    Okay?    Yes, Saradona?    So what you had before, though, that was like the, in, I think it's in Claude.    And it's like the long description of you.    Is that an assistant that you made, or is that a GVT?    That's just a prompt, essentially.    You can think of it like a GVT, or like any of other things.    It's just one that I only use for myself.    So if I go to look at it, so these instructions are, remember when I talked about it, said I gave it a bunch of articles, and I said extract out the style and tone and quality.    to this writer.    So this is what came out, and then I read all this and sort of revised it and made edits to it, and then there are also these 10 articles attached here.    And I think it might have like a history of my, when I write articles with it.    Yeah, so like here's like an example of, and this was probably like me out in the woods, like walking and just saying, can you read back the article so I can hear it, and then    And we go down.    It's just, I'm just listening to everything it says here, and then I'm just giving feedback at pre-act time.    Some of these are like 50 pages long.    So a little bit of a silly question with GVT then, right?    So one of the things is obviously that when you use craft, you're giving the role.    But for a lot of us, right, like whenever we're doing something, we're doing it in the role that we currently are.    Yep.    So then is it best, would you say, to create a chat GVT that has that like list of your role so that every time you go in to ask you a question, it always knows to do it in the context of, I am a nonprofit talent leader with this many years of experience that my main, you know, goals of my work are to do X, Y, Z.    So there are two different questions here, right?    So let me, I'll show you in chat GVT, not all the systems.    Let me check them real quick and see how badly we're doing here.    Pardon me.    Because I do want to give everybody a sense a little bit badly.    This could be a separate question.    We can just talk about this later.    No, no, It's okay.    So there are – in chat to QPT, you have settings.    So I have personalization where I can tell it about me, and it also has memories and other things about it.    And so in that regard, it has information that it always knows about me.    That's just in the settings.    Anything I do with chat QPT, it keeps that.    I have started to remove more of that information because I find it's more restricting than I want it to be.    But when I'm building custom projects or QPTs, I find that I'm different roles for different things I'm doing.    Sometimes I'm like this quirky cybersecurity guy who writes funny cybersecurity scripts.    Sometimes I'm a thoughtful, you know, thought leader.    who talks about, like, AI and nonprofits and everything.    Sometimes I'm a cybersecurity professional who has to help an organization manage their cybersecurity program.    I imagine most of you are like this.    We have different roles depending on what project.    So I would never want to constrain it to one role all the time because I will not get as good outputs.    Does that answer the question?    really helpful.    Because your author's voice is different if you're writing, let's say, a proposal versus talking with your students.    Yeah, yeah, it's really helpful.    Thank you.    and that's kind of the beauty of the AI is that you can start to think a little bit more about, wait, what are the differences of when I'm doing this versus when I'm doing that?    And how can I make that clear, right?    Just a quick question.    For ChatGPT, what's the difference between creating an agent and creating a custom GPT?    Well, ChatGPT, you can't make an agent.    You can use agent mode, right, in ChatGPT, which isn't very good right now in my experience.    But you can't make it.    Agents in ChatGPT right now that I'm aware of.    Okay.    All right.    We're going to attempt to get back on time.    We'll see how it goes.    So we're going to skip through a little bit of some of this stuff.    So if you're making one of these, which is what I want everybody to take a shot at now, you're going to start with, right, obviously a need that you have.    I need to write articles like this.    I need to screen applicants for our program.    I need to design a curriculum for an upcoming session I'm doing, right?    Some sort of recurring thing you have probably that's hard and requires a lot of thinking and writing and creating stuff, right?    So it's got to be worth – the juice has to be worth the squeeze for the effort you're going to put into this, right?    So I'm going to think there, and then I'm going to – once I've identified the task, the problem that I want help with, then I will devise a prompt that works really well to help with that.    Okay, once that prompt is working well, I'll – I    Try it out, and then I will convert it to a package.    Okay, so if I think about the meta prompt that I use, I think I need to make prompts to work with AI all the time.    So I would like to have a package that makes great prompts for me very quickly.    So I made this meta prompt, I tested it, I tested it, I tested it.    Once I felt like, okay, this is really consistently making great prompts for me with very little input for me.    Now I'm going to make it into a GPT, and now I can just go to it any time.    That's your process, okay?    But you can do it for literally anything.    Okay, so let's start with the meta prompt that we shared with last week.    You're going to make yourself a great prompt, and then you're going to turn that into a package in the environment that you have.    If you are a chat GPT, you're going to make a GPT from this prompt that you've made.    Okay.    If you're in Microsoft, you're going to make a co-pilot agent.    If you're in Gemini, you're going to make a gem.    Anyone in Claude?    Okay, so we don't have to talk about Claude as much.    That's fine.    Okay.    Just a quick show of hands.    How many Gemini people do we have in the room?    Now, are you?    And I mean, what you're using in the class for your platform.    Gemini?    Yeah.    Just two.    How many are ChatGPT?    Wow, most of us.    And Microsoft co-pilot.    Okay, so it's mostly co-pilot and ChatGPT, and then we got a couple of Google problems.    It's fine.    No, no, it's fine.    All right.    So, all right.    So, Kim, was the idea that we were going to have the meeting notes analyzer?  
  01:17:48 \- Kim Snyder  
      Yeah.    So, Josh, no, you don't have to do the meeting notes analyzer.    I'll come back.    The idea is you could even make the meta.    It's like if you don't already have the meta.    Prompt as a package, you can make that.    But the idea, Josh, was that you would demo it probably in ChatGPT from the looks of the hands.    The principles are the same.    Where you get them is a little different.    There are videos in the community on each of these different platforms.    But, yeah, the fact that they're differently named is a little bit of a headache right now.    But if you show in ChatGPT, like, where these things are, like the instructions, the title, you know, they're all similar.  
  01:18:34 \- Classroom 520  
      Okay.    So let's go ahead and show you how to do this.    So let's say I wanted to make a package from the meta prompt that we showed last week, okay, so that I can make quick prompts, okay?    If you want to try to follow along in your platform, you can do that, okay?    So I'm going to grab my meta prompt.    So the first thing I'm doing is I have this.    And I'm just going to grab all the text of it, OK?    OK, so these are just my instructions.    I'm going to go to ChatGPT.    And I'll do this in Gemini and Co-Pilot as well, OK?    And I need to go to Explore.    OK, if anyone's following along, I'm going to go up here.    I'm going to hit Create.    I'm going to name my GPT, Craft Metaprompt, Makes Great Prompts.    I'm going to pinstrum my prompt in the instructions.    And conversation starters are basically the text that a person sees, these little boxes that they can use to start the chat.    So I'll say, give me a crappy prompt.    And then I'll make it better.    Do you need plus for this?    It's telling me to upgrade.    If you're on the free version, you may not be able to make GPTs, yeah.    So if you have access to CoPilot or Gemini, I'll show that in just a little bit.    Now you can make an image for it.    You can use DALI or you can upload a photo to make your own image, and then it has an image that's associated with it.    You don't have to.    It'll just keep the default if you don't want to use an image.    I'm going to let it make one with DALI, and at a certain point, it will finish, and then it will allow me to create it.    Where's the GPT and ChatGPT?    If you are on a paid ChatGPT plan, you should see it in your left-hand sidebar.    If you click on Explorer, then you will see my GPTs and create.    If you're not on a paid...    plan.    You will not see that.    And this is taking a while.    So while we're waiting for that to finish, I'm going to go to Gemini and we're going to make a gem.    So in Gemini, you're going to see Explore Gems here in the lab for those of you that are Google folks.    Okay.    I'm going to create a new gem.    This looks very similar, right?    I'm going to give it a name, craft metaprompt, description, makes great prompts, pop in the instructions, and save.    Okay.    And that's in Google.    So now let's go to Copilot and see if this image got made yet.    Wow.    Really slow.    All right.    So we already made the whole thing Gemini.    Didn't even do it.    All right.    So let's go to Copilot.    So in Co-Pilot, if you are in a paid plan, and if your organization has enabled agents, not everybody will.    You will see them right here on the left.    You will see agents over here on the left, and then you will hit create agent.    Now, one thing I actually learned recently is that Co-Pilot made a kind of, like, wizard that helps you make a Co-Pilot agent, and it's actually really good.    So instead of going to configure and doing this manually, which is what I've been showing, and you'll notice that this now looks exactly like ChatGPT and Gemini Gems did, right?    You give it a name, you give it a description, you paste in the prompt of the instructions.    It should look very, very familiar.    But Microsoft lets you say, I would like to...    Like, you give a prompt and you say, I would like to make an agent that helps me make fantastic prompts from very simple prompts.    And it actually then keeps asking you questions forever until you tell it to stop and then it makes your agent for you.    And it actually does a pretty good job.    So for those of you that are in Microsoft, I actually would recommend this approach as a first try because it's so easy to just kind of tell Microsoft Co-Pilot, this is what I want the agent to do.    So now it wants a name and it's already made it, right?    It's already set up to help me.    I'm going to call it a super prompt.    And now the only thing that's annoying about this is that it literally, I have not found that it will ever stop asking you questions.    So you just at some point just have to hit create up in the upper left corner and then it will make it because it'll just keep asking you questions forever.    It's like, wait, when are you going to create my agent?    Anyway.    And if you tell it in the prompt, like, just create my agent, it'll say, yeah, so if you happen to make your agent, just one more question.    But it actually does a pretty nice job.    And you can still go and edit it.    You can actually see what it did under the hood.    So it made very simple instructions.    You can see those are a lot simpler.    So instead of the big meta prompt that I use, that big craft meta prompt, it made very, very simple instructions.    How would I know if this is better than my meta prompt?    Try.    Right.    Give both your craft meta prompt and the gem tick to the copot when you made the same prompt and see which one does better.    Right?    Okay.    So that was really quick.    I get it.    Any questions on packages?    Why to make them?    them?    Why Why    How to make them, what they're good for.    Yes, Allison?    So the thing that you copied from, where did you put it for Gemini?    Description or instruction?    Instructions.    Yep.    It's always going to be instructions.    The nice thing is that they all use instructions.    You're not an engineer.    No one knows what it looks like.    All right.    Other questions?    Yeah, they all call it instructions.    instructions in a package.    just, when you see instructions, just think prompt.    Okay.    That easy.    Yes, Allison?    easy to get in courts that, so you don't have to keep using the same prompt, rewriting the same prompt over and over and over again.    It's basically a built-in prompt.    You have the GPT ready to essentially, could be, if it's the kind of task you're going to be doing on a pretty good basis.    Yep.    Yep.    And one of the things I've been experimenting with a lot in the last month is...    is what I call interview prompts.    The workflow prompt that we all use is an example of an interview prompt.    I find these to be incredibly useful both for myself and for others.    So if I needed to get Ariana to give me three workflows for her organization, I could set up a Zoom with her and talk to her for an hour and interview her and take the transcript.    But if Ariana is willing, I could say, I have this prompt or this GPT.    Can you just go fill it out, answer all of its questions, and then send me the output that it gives you at the end of that?    And then I will get, if it works well, a beautiful workflow diagram and documentation from Ariana's specific workflow that she just did by answering the questions from my interview prompt.    So these interview prompts can be a really cool way to get information both from yourself or from others.    Another one I made is for vibe coding when I'm building applications.    is what's called a product requirements program.    So it asks me all the questions that, like, a developer would need to build a web application.    And so I just answer these questions, and then it creates something that helps me get to a working application much faster than I do on my own.    So there are lots of good examples of this.    All right, so what we're going to do next is deep research, and then while deep research is researching, we have an activity that I'm hoping will be fun.    And also a little silly, but also instructive.    All right, so most of these platforms now have what are called a deep research function.    A deep research function is actually a type of a narrow agent, meaning it actually goes out and performs work autonomously for you, all right, and then delivers a result.    Okay, what I mean by narrow, all right, is that they only...    Do research and then produce a report for the research that you asked for.    That's it.    It's not going to book you airline reservations.    It's not going to draft a new curriculum for you.    But if you say, research the best way to get airline reservations for the times that I want to go to Europe, you know, whatever, it will give you a wonderful report on how to do that.    Okay.    These are really, really useful tools.    And they don't hallucinate a lot.    They're pretty accurate and getting better all the time.    They cite their sources.    So they will provide you links and you can go validate that those links actually exist and are actually the information that it says.    So it gives you, right in the report, a way to validate that the report that you've been given is accurate.    Okay.    Obviously, you're going to want to do some of that.    Okay.    And these can do...    Literally hours or even days worth of work of a human being in 10 to 20 to 30 minutes without you having to do anything.    Okay?    Just incredibly useful.    So all of the platforms have like a deep research option.    Sometimes you can invoke it by saying, do deep research for me.    Just use the exact phrase, deep research, which will invoke it, so to speak.    But you can also manually invoke it in the platforms themselves.    So what I would like everybody to do is in their platform, and I will, again, show them very quickly.    Wow, it never made my image.    That is so annoying.    So cancel that.    So let's start with ChatTBT.    Who has a – well, I'll actually kick off three different research projects, one in ChatTBT, one in Gemini, and one in Copilot.    Who would like a research project in ChatTBT?    Yes.    Jalissa, what would you like to research?    Oh, you want me to research.    Yeah, You don't have to.    Oh, just anything?    Anything.    Okay, Carl, we've got one.    Can you search all the programs that are available to Google?    Some of you can point at both.    Okay, so what I'm doing is in chat GPT, if everybody watches, I'm clicking plus, and I'm doing G's research.    And then you'll see the research shows up in the little bar here.    Everybody see that?    So I added research?    Okay.    I actually got one.    we made it to that.    Okay.    So to make it better, like, I want to research about all the internships that are available for high school college students that are non-replaceable by AI automatization, you know what I mean?    Research all the job opportunities for high school graduates that are not likely to be replaced by AI.    AI.    Okay.    Please research all of the job opportunities that would be available for high school graduates that are unlikely to be replaced by artificial intelligence within the next five to ten years.    So what this will do is usually it will ask me some follow-up questions, okay, for some clarification things.    So as you can see, Julissa, it's asking a few questions.    I'm just going to say if it's time, make us some assumptions.    New York City.    New York City, all industries.    All industries.    Full-time careers, apprenticeships, and vocational training.    Internships.    Just internships?    Mostly.    Internships and travel.    Okay.    Salary, minimum wage.    Between, I guess, between like $17 to $20 an minimum wage.    Work environment.    Between $15 and $20 an hour.    11, 17, just $1.    $20.    13\.    Yeah.    And work environment, mostly in-person or hybrid?    In-person or hybrid?    at Rolling Stone.    Alright, and now it kicks off.    So now the agent is working, and sometimes you can kind of watch what it's doing, sometimes you can't.    This will take 5, 10, 20 minutes, just don't know.    So we'll go on to...    They're like Google, like Google, but instead of like you're creating a more detail, like what you want.    Instead of one page.    Yeah, but it's going to do an enormous amount of research in this period of time that we are doing.    So now let's go to co-pilot.    I'm going to go to the tools.    Explore more agents.    I don't want to do research.    I don't have that.    I'm trying to follow along, but I don't see how to get the tools.    Yeah, we're at ChatGBT.    You have to be at a paid ChatGBT plan.  
  01:32:57 \- Kim Snyder  
      I co-pilot.    Co-pilot.    Oh, is pilot.    Oh yeah, I actually don't see deep research.    There might be an agent that you'd have in your free-ish plan that's researcher.    That's what I've used.  
  01:33:15 \- Classroom 520  
      Is that a co-pilot?    You have that.    Search for research.    No?    Oh, that was true.    Yes.    Yeah, I do not have one, but everybody could search for agents, for researchers, and we don't have one.  
  01:33:33 \- Kim Snyder  
      If you don't have one.    to do deep research, right?    You can just pellet that as an answer.  
  01:33:39 \- Classroom 520  
      Yeah, so who has another deep research project for me?    Or do we want to see the same one in all three?    Oh, maybe it's learning.    No.    Here we go.    Same one?    Okay.    Oh, sorry, you can see I'm interested in an entry-level IT job.    Entry-level IT job.    It's the same kind of criteria, though.    Entry-Level IT.    And I'm going to see if this works.    I'm just going to say if he's performed deep research.    Oh, let's see what happens here.    I have it on my phone.    You do have deep research.    Yeah, mine is not working, so we will go.    Go to Gemini for mine.    If you do have that for Co-Pilot, you can definitely build an agent that would do it.    But I'm going to do...    So Gemini does have deep research, the exact same thing.    Those of you who are in Gemini, I'm just going to paste the same prompt in, and off we go.    Okay.    So what I would like everybody to do is take about two minutes to kick off a deep...    Research Project, if you have access to it, if you're TAT-QBT, Co-Pilot, or Gemini.    If not, that's okay, and then we're going to do a little activity while these projects are happening with us.    All right.    Can you get to create agents?    Yeah, I guess you can create, you know, I mean, Do you have a thing where it's that you can create an agent?    Yeah.    We just create an agent.    Like, he has created, has an agent, right?    pull one.    Like, pull one.    No.    Like, pull one.    I can create.    Yeah.    Justin, where are all the markers?    That doesn't.    I can't come out.    Oh.    okay.    Great.    Oh, Oh, okay, great.    I see.    But, yeah, when you create an agent, you can just put that onto.    Yeah.    I mean.    Yeah.    Do that.    Yeah.    Yeah.    Thank you so much.    I'm just telling you that it takes longer to take.    All right, Justin, can I get the handouts now?    I know.    I know.    You have to go on and review.    the class?    Yeah.    I'll stand up.    So when I ask that question, thinking about that.    Yeah.    This is what you're doing here.    Yeah.    No.    I saw this thing.    thing.    All right, while we are waiting for our deep research projects, we're going to do a little game, all right?    So I can give everybody's attention for a moment.    It's going to be a little tricky, not quite as tricky as last week, but we're going to need space on your tables to place this down.    It's okay if you only have access to like half of it, okay?    And this row and that row are going to be drawn, okay?    So we have drawers and we have instructors, okay?    So here's the way this works.    The drawers, I have a drawing here, okay, that the instructors will get to see.    You must not show it to your drawers, okay?    You, so you three, are going to talk to Carlton and Allison and Nana, okay?    And you're going to instruct them on how to draw the drawers.    that I'm going to give you.    Okay?    They may not, under any circumstances, look at the drawing.    You have five minutes to do this, and then we're going to put the drawings up on the board and see who did the best at achieving our drawing.    All right?    So does everybody understand the instructions?    We have markers.    Only the drawers read markers.    You can pass them all your markers so they have all the colors available to them.    I'm going to put this here.    me the instructions.    Okay?    Give the instructions.    Can I open the drawer?    I can open the If everybody can make room and sort of, yeah, perfect.    Okay?    All right?    Now, the folks in this row, in the second row, we have a little bit of a challenge because it's the same drawing for all the groups.    So you need to make sure that the sneaky peekers behind you don't peek at your drive.    Okay?    Hey, is...    Hey, this is...    This is very important, okay?    So you four are all going to be drawing what these four are going to be instructing you.    You're going to be group two, okay?    So all four of you can go over here and help to draw, and all four of you can give instructions, okay?    So don't let these sticky peepers be.    What do do?    We're be C to draw it, okay?    All right?    Are you going to go back to the ground?    Yeah.    Okay?    You may look at it as much as you want, okay?    Here's your drawing.    Guys, here's your drawing.    Do not let the sticky peepers be behind you.    Look at it.    Okay?    All right.    You all don't have to worry about it.    You're telling us.    Yeah.    Is it an A2?    No, you're a draw.    There's your drawing.    There's your drawing.    There's your Listen.    This is very important, okay?    So you four are all going to be drawing what these four are going to be instructing you.    You're going to be group two, okay?    So all four of you can go over here and help to draw, and all four of you can give instructions, okay?    So don't let these sticky peepers be.    What do do?    We're be C to draw it, okay?    All right?    Are you going to go back to the ground?    Yeah.    Okay?    You may look at it as much as you want, okay?    Here's your drawing.    Guys, here's your drawing.    Do not let the sticky peepers be behind you.    Look at it.    Okay?    All right.    You all don't have to worry about it.    You're telling us.    Yeah.    Is it an A2?    No, you're a draw.    There's your drawing.    There's your drawing.    There's your Listen.    Can I get, just, I need, uh, one question right here, and then one question right here.    You don't have a group, okay?    Why don't we make this table?    Have new drill.    Have a new drill.    Oh, yeah.    You guys are gonna have the drill.    Yeah.    Who wants to be instructed to go with the drill?    Yeah.    Yeah.    Yeah.    You either are giving instructions on what's drill or the drill.    We're gonna the drill.    We're gonna have the drill.    Yeah.    So...    I know you, but you really want that from last time.    There's so many people talking about it.    I didn't.    I that.    I this...    I gave this...    I gave this...    Good job.    know.    I think this interview was.    I    All right, does everybody have a team?    That they're on and know their role.    You're either a drawer or an instructor.    Yes?    Yes.    You're all the instructors.    Okay.    And you're all the drawers.    You're asking questions.    asking questions.    Okay.    Yeah, you can talk all you want.    You just can't show them the picture at any point.    Okay?    It's going to get very loud.    We were all drawing on wanting to get a picture.    Okay.    You're not supposed to have a picture.    You're –    Oh, I thought I gave you one.    So we can see what's the time.    Okay, your goal?    I know what are you doing in one page?    Yep, you're all drawing in one page.    You're all drawing together, okay?    One drawing as a group.    Okay?    One drawing as a group.    One drawing as a group.    So you have drawers, you have instructors, okay?    All right, we're going to start.    You have five minutes to try to get the most accurate drawing you can.    Do not let the drawers see the drawing.    On your marks.    Get set, and go\!    Just describe it on the hand.    You're actually waiting for the drawing.    You guys can go.    Talk to them.    Tell them how to draw it.    Do not show them the picture.    Do Do Do Do Do not    Fathom, Fathom, Fathom, Fathom, Fathom.    These guys are committed to the process.    Fathom, Fathom, Fathom, Fathom, Fathom, Fathom, Fathom, Fathom.    There we go.    Two minutes left.    Two minutes.    Song Song Song Hungry Song- Hungry- We'll be right back.    That's okay.    Okay, I gotta go.    Yeah, right there.    Okay, so.    I'm to.    Yes, I'm going to.    Okay, in the of the bottom.    Give it a lot.    30 seconds\!    30 seconds\!    30 seconds\!    30 seconds\!    seconds.    40 seconds.    40 seconds.    seconds.    seconds.    40 seconds.    40 seconds.    40 seconds.    40 seconds.    40 seconds.    seconds.    10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\.    40 seconds.    the floor.ああ.    35 seconds.    60 seconds.    That's fine, everybody get the part.    Just run them up\!    All right, so what do we think?    Oh, I don't have the original up.    Sorry, I thought I had it up.    See this.    Let me see what she looks like.    We're going to put the original up on the screen.    All right.    That is cute.    So, let's see, I feel like we're missing one.    should have had, oh, okay.    Here, I can come grab it.    Who do we think did the best here?    Who did it?    That's great.    All right.    What like the best?    Every original.    This one?    Yeah.    Whose team is this?    Us.    So what do you think made you successful at doing this?    Like, I mean, they give the right instructions.    Okay.    So I think, you know, followed with it.    And I think we did a good job.    Excellent.    Why?    First of all, what was, what was hard about this?    So in every project, you know, who's taking the lead?    We, you know, are we all giving instructions?    realized that we were wasting too much time back and forward giving instructions.    So we just, there you go.    Okay.    One person giving instructions.    Okay.    I would say describing what you're seeing on the paper, because it's not like, oh, draw a head, and it's like, well, everyone's head shape is not the name, you know what mean?    Or like, draw eyes, or making sure you put like a pupil in eyebrows, so like, making sure you've got those details.    Why do you think that we would do this exercise in this session today?    Yeah, go ahead.    To learn how important it is to give the right...    Prompts.    Yeah.    That we want.    Well, and also, it's hard.    It is hard.    Like, we think we know what we want in our head, until we start to try and describe it, and then it's, to your point over here, like, oh, wait, a head, that's kind of vague, right?    Is that useful as like, as a means of sort of understanding instructions?    Yeah.    Yeah.    And it's hard, right?    Like, I specifically asked for something I thought would be...    It's easy to draw if you could see it, but would be pretty hard to, like, tell someone else how to draw.    You know, and I think that was how it turned out to be, right?    I feel like it's a pretty simple drawing if you could just see it.    Even I could take a shot at and I'd terrible at drawing.    But it's hard to describe because it's an unusual drawing that you can't just say draw a robot, right?    Kind of a robot, but kind of not.    All right, so we're going to take a 10-minute break.    As with last week, we're not exactly sure when lunch is going to come.    It's to be coming very soon.    It's to be coming very soon.    So if we – we'll just eat, and I'll do some instruction, and then we'll go to our next activity.    So here's the way it's going to work.    Take 10 minutes.    Bathrooms are this way if you need them.    There's still more coffee and donuts, I think.    you.    Thank Thank So here's    Help yourself to those, but lunch is coming.    And then what we're going to cover next in the afternoon is we're going to go do some Notebook LM stuff for those of you that do have access to Gemini and show you how that works.    And then what we're going to spend the bulk of the time on, and I really do want you to get your hands on this, is exploratory data analysis.    So we have a data set, which is actually, and if you have your own data, you're welcome to pull it.    But what we're providing is the passenger manifest from the Titanic.    So there's lots of interesting things you could explore about survival by gender, by age, by what class passenger you were sitting in and other things.    So it's a data set that gives you lots of options for exploration and data visualizations.    And we're going to show you how to use any of these large language models to do.    exploratory data analysis, journalistic insights into data, and then data visualization.    And so that'll be the, obviously that's going to take us some time.    We'll have lots of questions.  
  01:55:13 \- Kim Snyder  
      So that's what we're going to be spending the remainder of our session on today.    Okay, so 10 minutes.  
  01:55:19 \- Classroom 520  
      Sometime in here will be lunch and then we'll get to work.  
  01:55:22 \- Kim Snyder  
      Can I just say one thing?    So first of all, thank y'all all for being in our space.  
  01:55:26 \- Classroom 520  
      This is, we share this, it's a workforce development space that a lot of organizations are in.    The back is where the kitchen is.    can use the sinks.    You can also use the coffee machines and like any of the plates and stuff.  
  01:55:39 \- Kim Snyder  
      You can sit in any of the like chairs and tables that are out here, like in this area.  
  01:55:45 \- Classroom 520  
      If you do need to like take a private call or something like that, we probably, some people are probably getting messages.    You can duck into one of the conference rooms.    Just check the icon to see if the room is booked.    And if it's not, then you can feel free to like go in there and sit.    That was it.    And thank you so    Look for the space.    is an awesome space.    Yeah, thank you.    All right.    Okay, everybody.    Great work this morning.    And yeah, let's go take a break, and then we'll finish strong for data balances.    Josh?    Yeah.    So I just want to let you know, I have some EDA examples that I can show.    Oh, I'll let you leave then.    I'll let you screen share if you're cool with that.  
  01:56:23 \- Kim Snyder  
      Yeah.  
  01:56:24 \- Classroom 520  
      So I have a bunch of examples with smaller data sets, as well as a, like, a, like, a Okay.    Do you think we should, do you think we should switch the Meet the Moment logo to the robot here?    He is in our color.    He's giving it a good run.    I think if the box were orange, then.    Yeah.    I did not come last time, so would you be able to add me to the community, so I'll be able to see all the materials.    Yeah, do we have your email?    I'm not sure.    I can give you my email.    Yeah, give me my email.    They'll send it to Kim.    Kim, this is Lee, you said?    It's Zee.    Zee.    Zee.    Okay, this is Zee.    He's going to, the camera's actually here, if you want to look at it.    And he's going to send you an email.    Could you add him to Circle for us?    Sure.    I'll tell him, I'll tell him.    It's Kim at mtm.now.    Very easy.    Yeah, I'll add you in.    You'll get an invite.    Kim at mtm, no, Kim at mtm.now.    Perfect.    Okay.    All right.    you.    Thank you.    So, if I could, as soon as we get out of the last seat, I'm going to have the way out of my phone.    go through that flight.    so, once we get out of the air, like, it's like, you're I'm going to have through flight.    I'm going to to go that I'm to have flight.    flight.    to that that have go through I'm to going to go through flight.    I'm to go that    Fathom, Fathom, Fathom.    Fathom, Fathom.    I actually would have a video.    I, I just, I'm like, what?    you?    You think it's going to be me?    Here we are.    Yeah, okay.    Thank you.    you.    Wow.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank Thank you.    So everybody, you guys need to start here real quick.    Here's the results for our research project.    Okay.    I think we're telling you for high school graduates.    You can see it is an extremely comprehensive report with many, many references, and where it references, you can see the reference.    reference.    And I will obviously share this in the community, but so it's, I don't know exactly how long it took, let's see, did it today?    That's why I was there.    20 minutes.    That's cool.    20 minutes.    It did 174 different services in the and I will share that out in the community after the class today, okay?    So everybody will have access to the class.    you.    Back in, as you were.    So I asked the same.    Yeah, remind me of your name again, sorry.    I'm sorry?    Really okay.    Randy?    Randy.    Randy, sorry.    Go ahead.    So I asked the same question.    Yeah, right?    It asked a couple more questions.    It's I guess, little agents.    It asked a couple of things.    Thank you.    you.    Thank Thank    And it came back with this totally different...    It's not a problem.    Yeah.    Probabilistic technology, right?    Even if you did ChatDBT twice, it would give you different results.    But ChatDBT be...    Yeah, it does.    But you do it five times, you get five...    Like you're saying, showed you.    So I didn't get that great.    Again, if you don't give it directions, it's going to make guesses.    It's okay like that.    Did you go to the other one?    Can you go to I came in here for doing it.    I said I came in like a 22th.    I said I came in like 22th.    I said I came like 22th.    Yeah.  
  02:02:03 \- Kim Snyder  
      So, you see that?  
  02:02:06 \- Classroom 520  
      So, you see that?  
  02:02:09 \- Kim Snyder  
      Well, never be here.  
  02:02:12 \- Classroom 520  
      when I looked at that, that's it.    It might know that about you.    It has a memory.    You've been chatting with Judge Witt.    It knows a lot about you.    So, think it's because it's Microsoft.    It has content.    Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  02:02:31 \- Kim Snyder  
      Yeah.  
  02:02:32 \- Classroom 520  
      Co-pilot, unless your organization has turned it off, has access to your email, your OneDrive, SharePoint, like, so it knows a fair amount of value.    So, Kim, you'll be ready to, you want me to do the Notebook LM and then you'll do the EDA?    Okay?    No, but I don't have to decide that you're too high school.  
  02:02:57 \- Kim Snyder  
      Okay?    I can't hear you, actually.  
  02:03:02 \- Classroom 520  
      Sure.    Can you hear me now?    Yeah.    So I'll start screen sharing, and I'll do Notebook LM, and then you'll do, when we get to EDA, I'll let you take over the screen share?    Yeah.    Okay.    And you're large now, because I'm not screen sharing anything, so if you want to, you're not huge.    But your face is, yeah.    Do I need to make up?    No, you look fine.    You look fine.    So I'm going to run out to the restroom for a bit.    I'll be back in a bit.    Okay.  
  02:03:41 \- Kim Snyder  
      Is this after lunch, or is it?  
  02:03:44 \- Classroom 520  
      Lunch is not here yet, but we're going to probably just teach through lunch.    We'll do Notebook LM and EDA through lunch, and that way they can eat, and then they can start working on the EDA stuff after.    I want to give them a lot of time with that.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Great session, the Very well designed, Kim.    This is excellent.    I want to see these drawings.    Oh, I can show you the drawings.    Oh, that's pretty good.    Yeah, they all did pretty good.    Wow.    Okay.    Yeah, I thought they came out pretty good.    I like that activity, actually.    Want to stand here?  
  02:04:52 \- Kim Snyder  
      Okay, great.    So you're seeing pictures of everything, right?  
  02:04:57 \- Classroom 520  
      I have not, but I will.    I want to ask them to rate the activities that we do for each session so for future we have a sense of which ones people have enjoyed the most.    want circulate that one, let them get up to the circle they get.    You know, it would be great.    So you said so, for that.    That's Thanks, people.    think I'm fine for now.    Me too.    So you've got to get up to the table.    I mean, just go to table.    Yeah.    I want to definitely not.    Can we share these drawings in the circle community, or does anyone want to claim intellectual property rights or anything?    I love you.    love you.    Thank you.    Thank you.    See, Joanna says she didn't grab it.    She says, same here, she hasn't received a thing.    She says, here's something they said.    She says, here's something they said.    here's something they said.    She says, said.    Hopefully.    Hopefully you won't.    I saw this.    What's that?    Okay, okay, I'll find out.    Thank you.    I'm going to take this, that's okay.    Yeah.    Okay, everybody, the food is here, so here's what we're going to do.    We're going to take 15 more minutes now, so you can go get food, eat.    We're going to start instructing again at 12.30 sharp, and so people can finish eating, hopefully be done with the food by 1, and then we'll put you to work on the exploratory data analysis, and then for 1 to 2, that's mostly what we're going to be doing, okay?    So make sure your laptops are charged, and go get yourself some food.    You got 15 minutes to chat, go to the restroom, do whatever, and then it's fine to bring food in here and eat from 12.30 to 1 if you need, okay?    You got 15 minutes the to to to to You chat, You got got to chat,    Fathom 520,233,ist, and non-disgustible panels.  
  02:10:40 \- Kim Snyder  
      talking about stuff like that, Katie, she was saying, okay, if it saves people time, what are they then using that time?    It's available for questions that I have.  
  02:11:13 \- Classroom 520  
      Lamere, can we go to AJ's?  
  02:11:19 \- Kim Snyder  
      Jim, I'm back.    So did you hear all that?    I heard some of it.    We're going to resume- 15 minutes to eat.    Yeah, we're going to resume instruction in 15 minutes, and then I'll do Notebook for like 5 or 10 minutes.  
  02:11:35 \- Classroom 520  
      I'll give it to you for about 15 to 20 to do EDA, and then we'll put them to work from 1 to 2\.  
  02:11:44 \- Kim Snyder  
      Yeah, no, that sounds good.    And I'm happy to show Notebook, actually.    Oh, yeah, I'll let you do, I'll let you take over them.  
  02:11:54 \- Classroom 520  
      If you're good with that.    If Yeah, because I have- I'll let you take a rest for a bit.    I have a Notebook Notebook Notebook-  
  02:12:00 \- Kim Snyder  
      That is a Notebook about Notebook, I think.    Yeah, we can hear you just fine in here.    Do you want to do a screen share and turn your camera on and I'll tell you what it looks like?  
  02:12:10 \- Classroom 520  
      Alrighty.  
  02:12:14 \- Kim Snyder  
      I can turn your volume up if it's a problem.  
  02:12:19 \- Classroom 520  
      So here's Notebook.    The intro looks great.    You don't have to have your camera on if you don't want to.    It's up to you.  
  02:12:27 \- Kim Snyder  
      Fine.  
  02:12:30 \- Classroom 520  
      And so that works, right?    Yeah, that's fine.  
  02:12:34 \- Kim Snyder  
      The PDA stuff I did, so.    Oh, beautiful.  
  02:12:38 \- Classroom 520  
      Awesome.    Now, almost none of them are using clods, so they will have a little clod to be, which is okay.  
  02:12:44 \- Kim Snyder  
      All right.  
  02:12:45 \- Classroom 520  
      I do have, like, penguins and stuff.  
  02:12:48 \- Kim Snyder  
      I'll do another.    You know what?    I'll do that same data set.    I'll run it now.    I'll do it with.  
  02:12:54 \- Classroom 520  
      When I did a show of hands, it was about, like, 60% chat GB.  
  02:12:57 \- Kim Snyder  
      GBT, 30% go pilot.  
  02:12:59 \- Classroom 520  
      I'll I'll do that.    10% Gemini, no one was Claude.    Okay, I'll do that same data set, although Claude did the coolest thing, you want to see?    Sure.    Did do a Choraplef, like, map.  
  02:13:10 \- Kim Snyder  
      I saw the heat map, which was pretty cool.    No, no, this is, like, this is, like, it did one of these.  
  02:13:18 \- Classroom 520  
      Wait, where is it?    I do not see your screen at the moment.    Chilly in here.    That's 64\.  
  02:13:26 \- Kim Snyder  
      That is chilly.  
  02:13:27 \- Classroom 520  
      Oh, my God, that looks good.  
  02:13:28 \- Kim Snyder  
      No, it did, like, and it did, like, a large one.  
  02:13:31 \- Classroom 520  
      Oh, my God.    That's called a Choraplef map?    Yeah, it's when they do, like, yeah, they do kind of mapping.    Oh, amazing, yeah.    I need give everybody Claude Envy, you know?    We'll give everyone Claude Envy.    I can, you know.    I think Claude Envy may become an official term.    Yes.    Has anyone asked what you use and I use?    Claude Envy.  
  02:13:55 \- Kim Snyder  
      All right.  
  02:13:56 \- Classroom 520  
      So, um, have, and get your lunch.    And I will.    We'll be here and ready to roll.    Awesome.    Thanks, Kim.    I'm going run the California housing data in ChatGPT right now.    Okay.    And they're all going to do the Titanic data.    they have access to the housing data that you're using?    I can put it in the community later if they want to play with it later.    But I have the Titanic for everyone to use.    Perfect.    And you got the URLs plus the QR codes are perfect.    So we have those for the data.    Awesome.    Okay.    this is what I've just said.    Yeah.    I'm creating because we don't have a capital.    Okay.    So we use Google.    We don't have access to Gemini.    So I'm going to say ChatGPT can create a portfolio right to my super life to give us access.    Free use.    Yeah.    I can help you in the business case.    Yeah.    All right.    Yeah.    So I couldn't...    Well, we can work on that for you.    Happy to.    Happy to.    to.    to.    Happy Happy    Yeah, will tell you, this is a, yeah, do you mind talking about this in the group?    Because I think it's useful for the group, actually.    Okay.    But I'll tell you privately, like, with dealing with executives, right, I think it's, depending on how much work you want to put in, I think it's really useful to describe the executives and the people to whom you need to make the case to them, who they are.    Because here is the audience I need to persuade, and here are the things that they care about, and here are the things that they are worried about, as far as I know, and as anyone else I don't.  
  02:15:37 \- Kim Snyder  
      And so I want you to help me think about how to present the most effective business case to that, that responds to both the things that they will care about, and the concerns that they are left about.    Well, I'm just ready to get involved, right, you know, a deputy representative of the people who I am not prepared to speak to anything, what is it?    Whatever it is, so you just want to, you know, and you don't always know, but you do have intuitions about it, you can say, here's what I think they'll see as potential to positive, one of those places, here's what I think will be there to drop through, so I'd like them to be able to respond to all of this, and that was like a strategy.  
  02:16:21 \- Classroom 520  
      I know, it's really such good idea not to be able to do a little work, so.    Oh, no, no, no, no, well, you have to.    Yeah, I have to say it, Should you make a little sandy?    Yogurt?    Let me just do something.  
  02:16:55 \- Kim Snyder  
      Thank you.  
  02:16:57 \- Classroom 520  
      .    Let's see how many names I can get before the end of this thing.    Which?    What is your name, by the way?  
  02:17:38 \- Kim Snyder  
      Luann Blaubor.    Luann.    Yeah.    Thanks.    Hey, Kim?    Yes?    Someone named Michelle asked a good question, so I'm going to take a few minutes with the group to talk about it.    I'm sorry, about the policy that the...    Getting the executives to approve AI for their organization.  
  02:17:58 \- Classroom 520  
      Again, we will talk...    Talk more about that next session and the session after, because it's responsible AI, but in fact, one of the kind of homeworks that folks can do, and it's not on the slides, is dig around and see if there's any AI policy in your organization.    And if you come back with nothing, don't feel bad.    Okay.  
  02:18:25 \- Kim Snyder  
      Man, it's freezing in here.    Yeah, I almost froze, like, we were frozen in the session we did yesterday.    Holy crap.  
  02:18:37 \- Classroom 520  
      Oh, how'd your session go?    Good.  
  02:18:40 \- Kim Snyder  
      I think it was a little awkward.    Yeah, how so?  
  02:18:43 \- Classroom 520  
      There's two vendors, right?    And then one person said, like, to Neo, right, so how can you afford to have, like, so you have three vendors on this, like, Meet the Moment, Roundtable, and, you know, whatever the group is, Personified.    person said, like, And And then    That's interesting.    And I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, I was with Roundtable, so.    Okay, it was just two vendors, yeah.    That's funny.    I think fiscal sponsors don't care about that.    How was the conference in general?    I didn't really do the conference because I didn't register.    Okay.    was like $500 or $600, and it's just.    Oh, dear, okay.    It's not our, I was just there to speak.    And has your flight been canceled, or are you going to be able to get back, do think?    We'll be able to get back because we're hub to hub.    Okay.    Jessica moved her flight to today.    was able to?    Good.    She was, yeah.    Jessica moved her flight to today.    All right, I'm going to go grab some food.    Grab food.    I'll be here.    I'm going to go grab some food.    I'm going to go food.    I'm go grab food.    to to go I'm going food.    food.    So we can't do it.    She booked my ticket.    One seat and then six.    Third.    And she's like, I hope you're good.    She's good one.    But now look at what I'm doing.    Exactly.    I'm not going to have to find the work.    She's looking for it.    She's it.    She's for She's for it.    She's for it.    She's for People don't change.    It's almost hard.    I'm thinking about They don't have to let me know.    She's looking for I'm not going to it.    I can't buy it.    She's going to write some of her.    She said..    look what my..    you Thank you.    It's a number, it's a number, it's number, $10.    Thank of us.    Just to see what we're seeing.    They did a tour with me, I came there, they did a with me, they said, did a tour with me, said, they went throughout my stuff.    They went through my job.    They went toilet, went toilet, toilet, they went toilet, and I said, Thank you.    And there's some story, right?    Exactly.    don't think there's a lot of things.    I'm talking about Yeah, it's all the story.    Yeah, it's all the story.    Exactly.    And I was told all of the room.    That's a lot.    I didn't embarrass the room.    It's all the story.    I didn't embarrass the room.    I didn't Oh, I was paid for payroll.    It's in itself.    If I was paid for you, you wouldn't have paid for me.    Oh.    Shh.    Well, I must be an excuse, but I did it.    I don't know what the whole time is.    No, no.    There are weird people out there.    No, it's really funny.    If you heard it, all the breaking things.    was a marketer.    Hold on.    No, it's not funny.    Oh, yeah.    course.    No, it's not the one.    If want to be.    Come Hopefully.    We'll    Fathom, Fathom, Fathom.    Fathom, Fathom, Fathom, Fathom.    Fathom, Fathom.    Do you like a better area of the drawing or the balls?    Or neither?    balls.    Balls more fun?    But I've done the, but it's partially because I've done this one before.    Oh, okay.    In our trainings, we do it for our VEX stuff as well.    Oh, cool.    Yeah.    It's a good training for that.    Okay.    Thanks.    Well.    I would give instructions a lot.    Yeah.    And also have the divide roles of the team.    Yes.    Very quickly learn who is like a...    Yeah.    Get this done.    With the bald activity I've done with that.    That was super fun.    That was super fun.    Okay.    I've done this activity also, but I didn't have stuff with Legos.    What would be there?    would have like a very simple Lego sculpture.    Oh, yeah.    Oh, Oh, yeah.    That would be a good one.    I bought like such a small Lego set and I remember thinking to myself, wow, little children do this.    This is very hard to do.    People who like it though love it.    I've had a wonderful time with it.    It's such a great like activity to take your mind off the Lego.    Like, I'm glad they have like a...    Don't be doing things now, like to make the case and stuff like that.    They have an amazing Lego set.    Yeah.    have a beautiful, there's one I bought as a gift for someone, it's Birds of Paradise, a flower, and she's, she actually like mounted it in her house, it looks great.    Yeah, it's really awesome.    Does anybody watch Abbott Elementary?    Yeah.    Yeah.    So do you remember when, oh god, I'm really bad with the names of the characters, but when Janine was not dating the, uh, who used to be Chris in his rock show, what's his name, the character?    Uh, I forgot his name.    I know what he's talking about, though.    I'm not gonna say that.    Okay, alright.    Well, I'm gonna call him Chris for right now.    They were like dating different people, and they like bought presents for their person.    Oh, they didn't like it, but the, obviously, like.    bought Legos for his like girlfriends, and Janine was like, oh my god, that's an amazing present, and then.    And the other guy bought her, like, a really fancy purse, and she, like, got the purse, and she was like, she was like, oh, that's great.    And so it was just super cute to see, like, also that it, like, matches your personality, and she loved her, like, a good pair of her.    Anyway, I don't know why that was that.    It's a gift-giving calendar, right?    I mean, the gift that you want, the other person, the person's a gift that they want.    Yes.    That's That's what you do when you have siblings.    what you want for Christmas, because the movie, what do you want to do with this?    Can I borrow it?    There you go.    I can play with it.    All right.    While we're, while people are drifting back in, we're going to, I'm going to talk briefly about something that we're going to hit on in sessions three and four much more intensive, which is, for those of you that are at organizations where they're not paid particularly supportive of AI, can try.    And    We're giving you access to tools that you might want.    We're going to show a couple of tools, Numbuk, L.M., Claude.    The question came up of how do we sort of persuade our leadership of the value of these tools and to allow us access to them, allow them to use in our organization?    And this is obviously a very useful thing to have AI help you with.    Right?    You make a business case.    But one strategy I would give you as someone who works with executives a lot is that it is relative to this gift of conversation that we were just having.    It starts from the perspective of trying to understand what the executives want and what the executives are concerned about first.    much.    Thank    Before you try to persuade them of what you want.    Okay, so first understand, then persuade, and think of AI the same way.    Your AI should first understand, as much as you can possibly explain, about your executives, what they care about, what are likely to be the benefits of AI that would be meaningful to them, what are the concerns about AI that they will have, right?    And give the AI all that information, and then say, now help me make a business case that will be responsive to them.    And that will, I think, put you in a much better position for success than just coming in with why it's important to you.    Okay, so that's like just a little bit of one-on-one advice.    Are there any executives here in the room?    Any like decision makers?    Yes.    Randy, so do you agree or disagree with anything I just said?    Agree, and would also add the security.    a dump if a lot of us are doing what participated.    Yep.    go back and dump it aside.    And my CEO's question always is that return on the best degree.    Okay.    CFO as well.    What are we getting for the spend?    Yep.    And because a lot of us get our funding from third party, are we, is it going to keep us compliant for funders?    the funders support the use of it?    And how can we build even more of it?    Gotcha.    Okay.    All right.    So Randy added, who represents the executives in the room, added that one of the concerns that she observed executives having and that she killed herself is the security and data privacy of the tool.  
  02:30:57 \- Kim Snyder  
      So that would be a concern that you would want to.    my God.    Thank    Respond to, in your request for access to these tools, that here's our plan to address the security and data privacy, right, so that it's manageable, that we are in compliance with any of the regulations we need.    And the other point she made, this is always going to be true of executives, is a demonstrable return on investment.    Okay, how will you quantify in some meaningful way the benefits of that?    So if I spend $1,000 a month on AI tools for the organization, show me how we get $2,000 a month back in gains that I can measure and will be persuaded by, right?    It's that simple.    Okay, so I think those are great points.    All right, with that, Kim, if you're there, coming to us from Arizona, I will hand it to you.    Coming to you live from Arizona.    All righty, so let me...    Can I crank up volume for her if you need it?    need it up?    Okay.    I was going to say, no, I'm good if I'm writing it for her.    You over there.    Alrighty.    So, hello.    I so wish I could be there today, but I am here, and I'm almost there.    I'm going to share my whole desktop, and there's a reason for that, but here you go.    So, all right.    So, you should hopefully see that pretty well.    So, document and data analysis.    the degree, oops, whoops, yikes, what's happening?    And the degree to which AI, oops, went way ahead.    The degree to which AI tools, generative AI, has changed how we can deal with unstructured data, okay?    In other words, language, and things like that, is really pretty amazing.    And that's the first thing I'm going to.    We're talk about here.    And then we're going to look at data analysis.    So that's the structured stuff.    Okay.    So we've heard some talk about Google Notebook LM.    There's also more recently Copilot Notebook, right?    And so these are, and they're best seen as opposed to hearing me kind of yammer about them, but they can consume large amounts of kind of text and actually image and with Google Notebook, you know, multimedia, like audio files as well.    Okay.    And they can consume these large sources of text or multiple.    And I think in the paid workspace account, you have up to 300\.    And I think even on your, you know, like a personal Google account, you get, you have 50 documents or sources that you can include.    Now, bear in mind on any personal accounts or personal usage.    So always like, you want to make sure, uh,    Am I putting stuff that I want to have in the system up there?    So, again, mind the privacy and any sensitive information.    But that said, what these tools are able to do with these vast amounts of information is really quite amazing.    So I am not going to, I'm just going to show you, okay?    Okay, so Google Notebook LM, and, you know, I can't see show of hands, but I get a sense that some of you have Google Workspace or access to Google through your organizations, right?    And so I use, as you can see, I use it all the time.    I made a Google Notebook.    So each of these things, by the way, Notebook.  
  02:34:47 \- Classroom 520  
      So each of these is on, like, use their own network.  
  02:34:51 \- Kim Snyder  
      I also use them for learning.    Like, this is a, you know, Josh and I will often share things when we go to some kind of training.    Training Program, where when there's lots of information, or Tina Wong, who's one of the people I follow, both follow a lot on social media about AI, I basically put her YouTube videos in here.    I might not have that, but this is the wrong notebook.    Sorry about that.    But anyway, so you can see I did some Generative AI in the Future of Work.    That was helping me kind of sort through a lot of documents, and, you know, as I was preparing curriculum for this class.    So this is a Google Notebook, and I'm happy to share it with folks, and I can put a link to it in the community.    This is a Google Notebook about Google Notebook, so it's a little meta.    But you can see there's tons of sources.    Now, I did deep research.    Okay, so this is where that comes to me.    You all just did deep research, or you just saw deep research being done on a topic, right?    And at the very end of the deep research, it churns out like a list of sources.    All right.    Well, I basically did a deep research on Google Notebook LM.  
  02:36:05 \- Classroom 520  
      It got a list of sources, and I brought them in here because I wanted to synthesize the information.  
  02:36:11 \- Kim Snyder  
      So this is a lot of videos, websites, et cetera, PDFs on Google Notebook LM.    So I can take all that stuff, and I made a mind map, so I can see how this all kind of is organized.    I use this all the time.    I have a client that I've been working with, and we've been working on a data migration project of kind of nightmarish proportions for the past, oh, God, like 14 months.    And so I have all of our meeting notes in a Google Notebook, and so I can ask it things like, when did we talk about this integration with the Healthix system?    for example.    And we'll find the notes.  
  02:37:02 \- Classroom 520  
      Okay.    I can also say, let me look at the different themes that have come up over the course of this project.    That is more the type of thing for a mind map.    Okay.    So that's like one thing it does.    I use this all the time.    But it also, so in Google Notebook LM Studio, Josh showed you, I think, the debate, right, on the two, at the very beginning of the session today, the debate on the two different, like, is ROI, you know, is there no ROI on AI or is there a lot, right?  
  02:37:36 \- Kim Snyder  
      That whole debate.    So you can create an audio overview.    Oops.    No, I don't want to make one.    Oops.    I meant to hit at it.  
  02:37:44 \- Classroom 520  
      Sorry.  
  02:37:46 \- Kim Snyder  
      But you can, ugh.    All right.    And now it's making them.    Sorry about that.    But if you click edit, you can say, give me a deep dive, you know, a brief one.    You can make a shorter line.  
  02:38:00 \- Classroom 520  
      Or you can have a debate, right?    these speakers, they constantly roll out.  
  02:38:04 \- Kim Snyder  
      One important thing is the what should the AI host focus on in this episode is a place you can actually put a prompt.    You don't have a lot of characters there.    I think it's like 2,000.    But you can tell it to give you an audio overview or debate or whatever, specifically on the topic you want or specifically the way you want.    Sorry, go ahead.    No worries.    So, yeah, so this is your, so you can focus it, all right?    So I'm going to, can you stop these now?    All right.    You can also do video overviews, right?    So you can do, okay, this is new, right?    I haven't seen this, Josh.    you, like the whiteboard style?    All right.    I made, actually, there's a video overview of the kind of responsible AI 18 points document that, you know, Justin at WPTI gave me when we started this app.    So that's in the session.    That's how that video overview was made.    So suffice it to say you can quiz yourself, you can make flashcards.  
  02:39:08 \- Classroom 520  
      This is an amazing tool for bringing together lots of pieces of information.    You can also, of course, ask it questions, right?    So you can, those are suggested questions, but I could ask it any kinds of questions about these documents that it has.    All right, so here we're seeing a capacity to use, you know, to really synthesize a huge amount of content and make sense out of stuff, right?    And you'll notice a thing I really like about when you ask it, and this is where, this is the use case in my data migration project, right?    When I ask it a question, like, when did we talk about the Healthix migration, it will then give me these little kind of footnotes about, like, where...    That point is, so I can then click right to that source and take a look at it, right?    So this is Google Notebook LM.    Just to make a couple other points, I just wanted to circle back to when Ariana was asking before about this, you know, idea of when we talked about retrieval augmented generation, getting it to respond to questions but only using the data sources.  
  02:40:24 \- Kim Snyder  
      This is the tool I was talking about.    This is literally the only, like, consumer-use tool that does that really well right now, okay, is Notebook LM.    I would also say Notebook LM is, in my opinion, the most powerful, useful, fun, and no one uses it and no one knows about it, AI product that is out there.  
  02:40:47 \- Classroom 520  
      I've never seen stories about it in the news, it's all AI, chat, GPT, and all this other stuff.    I think Notebook LM is an incredible AI product that just no one talks about.    Last thing I'll say is the audio overviews of the video.  
  02:41:00 \- Kim Snyder  
      overviews, I should point out that regardless of what language your sources are in, you can ask to have those output in something on the order of 80 different languages.    So you can have like a podcast made in any of about 80 different languages to state the language I would like to audio review in this language, and it will output it in that language.    So I will say that Google Notebook, I agree 100% with everything Josh just said.  
  02:41:24 \- Classroom 520  
      Like, again, I don't know why it doesn't get more, like, noticed, but this tool has changed the way I work as much, if not more so, in some ways, than the other AI tools, okay?    I use it all the time.    So if you do have access to Google, give it a try.    Notebooklm.google.com, you're in with your account, okay?  
  02:41:51 \- Kim Snyder  
      And again, it used to be there was no other tool, anything like this.    Microsoft has added a Notebook to Co-Pilot, it's not anywhere near the same functionality, but    But it is an approximation, and it's still very useful.    Yeah.    The CHAT-GPT does not have this.    No problem.    And Claude doesn't have this either.    Okay?    So, I encourage you to take a look if you get a chance.    All right.    So, these slides are just, all right.    All right.    So, any questions before I head on to exploratory data analysis?    Yes, Arianna.    I'm sorry.    I'm the question person today, apparently.  
  02:42:32 \- Classroom 520  
      So, then, if you're switching between when you use Google Notebook LM and CHAT-GPT, like, what's an example of what you'll turn to CHAT-GPT for versus Google Notebook LM?    Can you hear that, Kim?    And do you want to answer or do me to?    I want you to answer.    So, when I first tried Google Notebook, I kind of, I was frustrated in the very beginning, because I wanted it.    wanted to sort of,    Produce more stuff.    I wanted it to be more generative, right?    It's really based on the stuff you put in there, right?    So it's not like, it's not going to be the best tool.  
  02:43:13 \- Kim Snyder  
      It can, I use it for things like write a summary of, you know, these 18 sources, okay?    But it's not going to write me that summary, like it's not, it's not like the craft prompt is not going to work as well in there.    Because it's really about the sources that are in there.    And, um, the workflow prop that we did before would be terrible in notebook.    Terrible.    It would not work.    Okay.    So it's basically like the name.  
  02:43:44 \- Classroom 520  
      It's a notebook.  
  02:43:45 \- Kim Snyder  
      And as many notebooks as you put in there, it can help you, like, it's like if your brain never forgot anything that you put in there.    That I put in there.    And it synthesizes information.    But it's even better than that.    Because it's like if your brain didn't.    Forget anything, but I could say, hey, Braid, right now, I only want you to remember the three policies that we worked on in those meetings in the last two weeks.    And that, when I think now, I only want you to think of those things, and it will remember just those.    Really cool.  
  02:44:17 \- Classroom 520  
      If you can do stuff, like, you see how all of these things are checked off?    I can say, you know, give me a summary of this source.    I can say, I can do a debate between a limited number of sources in my whole set, right?    But its world is much more the world that I've put in it.  
  02:44:42 \- Kim Snyder  
      You know.    So, you can, you know, click and unclick, and there's lots of different sources.    And one of the things that we'll also do, this is almost, this is kind of like deep research light.  
  02:44:55 \- Classroom 520  
      So, you see, it's kind of, it's telling me all these things, right?    I can    Also, Discover.    So it will Discover, so I can give it a prompt, and it will, you know, bring in some additional sources, or it will identify additional sources out on the web, but that's as much as it kind of goes outside.    Otherwise, it stays in web house.    If look at the sources that it's referencing, if you close that screen, Kim, that I Discover, you'll notice that there are links to the sources there.    All those links, that deep research project that I did before, those links are going to take you out to some website that it's referencing.    These are only going to link to the sources that are in that notebook.    Every link is going to a source in that notebook, nowhere else.    Thank you.    look, in this video, it's bragging about itself.    98% citation accuracy.    It is, like, the most accurate, okay?    If you need to limit it to these sources, but don't, yeah, but it's when you start wanting it to do a whole lot more.    That it starts to do a little bit.    I have a question.    Thank you.  
  02:45:59 \- Kim Snyder  
      have question.    Go ahead.  
  02:46:00 \- Classroom 520  
      Yes.    And what's your name again?    I'm sorry.  
  02:46:02 \- Kim Snyder  
      Darley.    Darley?    Darley.    D-A-R-L-Y.    So if I want to start the notebook usage and provide, you know, data from my own organization data system collection, right?    Different program, different whatnot.    I'm populating that.    So at some point I go back to say, okay, based on the information that you have for program X, I want to know, you know, all these different criteria.    It just will stay within that parameter.    And how do I connect my data collection system to the notebook?    You would have to upload them as sources.    You have to leave them PDFs or Google documents or other things, and then you add them as sources.    They can be lots of different things.    You can have audio files, YouTube videos, PDFs.    I don't think it takes Word documents, but it takes Google documents, Google slide decks.    So...    You know what I noticed, Josh?    Yeah.    It takes spreadsheets now.    Yes.    So that's like, so, you know, so it's, so you just go in, and you also can refresh.    So I have these Jaegundo notes documents that I have, you know, for that project.    And, you know, I add things to it.    And so I can just hit refresh, and then it has the latest version.    But it's limited to its own universe.    All right.    So it's a jam.    No pun intended.    All right.    On to exploratory data analysis.    So what do we mean by exploratory data analysis?    Well, has anyone ever, like, given you, like, if you've ever been in a position of, like, we have this, like, giant spreadsheet here of participants for the last 20 years.    You know, can you look at this and make sense out of it?    That is a task in need of exploratory data analysis, right?    So it is exactly as it sounds, it's exploring the data that you give it, and it is using the AI powers to discern patterns within the data and to help you make sense of the data.    The exploratory data analysis is also very helpful in even describing the data that you have.    Like, what's in here?    It's also good at, say you get a whole bunch of data, and again, you want to be mindful of the tools you use.    That's why it's important that organizations have, like, approved systems.    But you can also give it a data set and see if it's data that you suspect is really, like, a mess.    You can also ask, like, you know, what needs to happen to this data, and it can even do, okay?    Okay.    Some data cleaning, right?    Some.    It's not going to read anyone's mind, but it can do stuff like formatting phone numbers, zip codes, et cetera.    can identify missing values, things like that.    And so it's kind of like, these are different levels of, so you kind of, you know, what it does.    So you give it data, and you basically, we have a prompt, of course.    Make sure I'm getting ahead of myself.    Okay, yep.    Okay, we have a prompt, no surprise, that is an exploratory data analysis prompt.    This is another one of Joshua's wonders of the AI world.    Well, actually was from Tina originally.    had that.    Oh, this is, oh yeah?    This is, okay.    So this is a craft style prompt that basically tells the system to do exploratory data analysis.    Another terminal, another piece of terminology.    Data Journalism Style Report.    So what that means is do the exploratory analysis and then provide it back to me in a way that explains it, right?    And provides me with insights and information, you know, about this data set.  
  02:50:20 \- Classroom 520  
      So you're under covering patterns, trends, relationships, et cetera, and then you want to translate that into a story.  
  02:50:28 \- Kim Snyder  
      What story does this data tell, right?    And so the rule is you're a data analyst, data journalist.    This is in the community for you and you will actually get this hopefully.    And basically it's asking it to explore data in stage one and then put together a report and, you know, and it defines the format and the target audience.    So it's the same kind of craft structure prompt.  
  02:50:56 \- Classroom 520  
      All right, so let's see what kinds of stuff.  
  02:51:00 \- Kim Snyder  
      Dropping this prompt in with a CSV file, what it does.    So, all the systems do it.  
  02:51:07 \- Classroom 520  
      Now, this is a smaller data set, granted, of penguins on the Palmer Island set, right?    Up in the, like, park itself.  
  02:51:19 \- Kim Snyder  
      Someone have a question?    Sorry, Chris.  
  02:51:22 \- Classroom 520  
      Go ahead.    Okay.  
  02:51:24 \- Kim Snyder  
      So, I basically gave it that long prompt and the penguins' data.    If you want to see the penguins' data, it wasn't, like, hugely complex.    It's, you know, 300 or so rows of data.    Not too messy, right?    But I, you know, dropped it in here.    And from that, it starts, this is Google Gemini, right?    I didn't use a gem.    This is just Google Gemini.    Can you all see those okay?    Or you want to zoom that up?    great.    All right.    me close you.    Yeah, I can, I can zoom in on this a little bit.    Just so they can see it, Kim.    So, um, and it's...    up a little bit?    Oh, no, if have a request, I want to zoom up if you can.    Okay.    So we've got, like, how the bill, like, so the penguins' bills, how they cluster by size of the bill.    These are each different types of penguins.    This is, like, a box and whisker chart, right?    As a cat person, this is one of my favorites.    So it's kind of looking at the distribution of the Adelie penguin, the Gentoo, and the Chinstrap, right?    And gender.    And then this is where do they live, right?    Which islands do these penguins live on, et cetera.    And this is a heat map.    Now, sometimes I'll look at these visualizations and I'll think, well, does that really make sense?    Okay.    So you can dig further for sure.    This is just the first round.    So then it's giving me stuff in a narrative format, right?    Here's a data journalism report, and here it wrote a whole report, right?    More than just black and white.    You can give it a catchy title.    All right?    So that's Google Gemini on penguins.    Okay, so let's see what did ChatGPT do with these penguins, okay?    Similar types of charts, not surprising because it's this kind of data, right?    Not quite as snazzy, but not bad.    It did one of these scatter plots, which is cool, right?    So it did a lot of similar types of exploratory data, you know, from the set.    There's only a limited amount of information to get from this because it is this penguin set of data.    And then, you know, it gave, it gives us some    more data.    It also tells us which data is missing, right, from a lot of this data set.    So 11 rows in this set, 3.2% don't have the gender, you know, there's a few missing.    So it's trying to kind of help me look at, you know, how clean is this data as well, which I find very helpful.    So it can do all kinds of different statistics.    So that's penguin data.    But let's say, I'll say penguin data, no big deal.    340 penguins, not a lot of information about them.    Okay, but let's give it something a little bit more robust.    So there's this other data set, and I can, these will be in the community so you can play around with them because they're completely safe public data.    This is about 20,600 in the 1990s housing data from California, right?    So it's talking about location, the amount of space, bedrooms, et cetera, and price.    And income a person who lived there in the 90s.    So this is starting to get into more factors here.    So this is it exploring.    So it's thinking, right?    And then, so it's giving me this, you know, in the quick scan.    It's missing 207 of these records don't have anything in the total bedroom field.  
  02:55:20 \- Classroom 520  
      We can see it's giving us some general statistics, but it's also producing some kind of, and I'm to bring these in because I had to download them for some reason.    And, right, so it's giving me, notice this looks kind of like the state of California, don't you think?  
  02:55:37 \- Kim Snyder  
      Right, because this is latitude and longitude.    It's also median house value.    So it looks like we had, scattered around and then boom, a whole bunch of them.    They must have limited it.    It was like $500,000 plus.    And you can see in California real estate was high in the 90s.    And there were a lot in this.    So, Um...    All right?    So this is what it can do.    This is median value by ocean proximity.    Now, I wanted to see, whoops, if it can do.    Now, this is kind of cool.    This is looking at it.    This is what's called the coropleft.    So it's taking different chunks.    You see these in the news.    Like, what chunk of it, like, it's kind of dividing it up so that you can see the distribution in different areas better.    There's also, the way, Kim, known as the Minecraft charts for a song.    Looks like a blood thing fast.    Yeah, yeah.    Go ahead.    Sorry, Kim.    No, no.    No worries.    So, and then it does this whole style report.    Right?    I think I did ask it to do, did it do that?    By county level.    Oh, it needed more.    Oh, God.    It needs more information to the county level.    I was trying to get a fancy.    All right?    So that's ChatGPT.    So it handled a massive data set pretty well.    I also gave that same massive data set.    to Copilot, and I wasn't sure what it would do.    And actually, if I were really working in Copilot, seriously, today, if my organization already had, like if it had really rolled out, Copilot within the Microsoft product, and, you know, they are doing this, and a certain, but it's, I think it's, there's a lot of organizations probably have it by now, where you can use Copilot in the apps.  
  02:57:27 \- Classroom 520  
      It's not going to be grounded in your work, but you can ask it to do things like this type of data, exploratory data.    I might have actually asked it to do this in Excel.    I might have brought this in as an Excel sheet.    But I used the same process, and it kind of, it's exploratory's first step, describe the data, that is true.    It's a little less, what should I say, like, you know, pretty, but it did generate some charts.    Right?    This is, see this looking like how.    California, right?    This is like, wow, what even is this?    But I guess a lot of folks are near the bay.  
  02:58:07 \- Kim Snyder  
      So it's, so Copilot also does this out of the box.    I will say, we're not gonna, because a lot of people don't, most people don't have Claude.    I have to say, Claude does the prettiest ones of these, but, you know, it's the nicest one.    I did warn Kim that we're gonna have a lot of Claude envy in the room.    Yeah.    It's not the data visualization.    Claude, out of the current models, Claude really does by a wide margin of best data visualizations.    Right now, of the four tools that were tossed across the cellar, that's a need that you have to do really high-quality data visualizations on your own.    would, you know, that's a business case to get a Claude license for that, which is, you know, $20, $30 a month.    for one user license, but it's not crazy expensive, but not everybody is getting to do this in your work, so.    But how long would this have taken me to do, right?    Yeah, yeah, yeah.    And let me understand the data.    Now, there's a huge caveat here, and that's coming up in a few slides.    Yes, I put those risk slides in there, Josh.    Because these are so pretty, right?    You still need to check them for accuracy.  
  02:59:28 \- Classroom 520  
      And it's easy to kind of get seduced by how professional and perfect they look.    So you want to sense check these type visualizations and reports as well, which I do.    But I'd still say, using this data to generate these visualizations and this report so that I can understand and see things in the data better is going to take me, and validate it, check, you know, like 10, 20% of the records, right?  
  02:59:58 \- Kim Snyder  
      It's going to take me less time.    And it has revealed things about, like, we use this in our work.    We do sometimes work where we were asking folks around satisfaction with IT support in their organizations, and it allowed us to see patterns that we otherwise might not have seen.    And that's what's really pretty cool.    So, anyway, so I think...    We have a question in the room, and then I have a couple of comments I want to make before we go on to the next.    Go ahead.    I don't know if I'm skipping ahead, but obviously the data sets that are being used here, it's, like, publicly available data, but for our own data within organizations, obviously there's a lot of PII.    Are there going to be practices here for data anonymization to be able to use these tools?  
  03:00:47 \- Classroom 520  
      Did you hear that, Kim?  
  03:00:48 \- Kim Snyder  
      And do you want to answer, or do you want me to?    Yeah, well, here's the funny thing about anonymization, right?    It's hard to truly anonymize data.    I will say that...    If the data, I mean, you want to, and again, as an organization, in session four, we're going to talk a lot about, like, rolling this stuff out or helping your leaders at your organization roll out AI responsibly.    You know, you may have some policies or certain record sets are, like, off limits.    But if you think about it, if you're using it in your enterprise, right, so in your Google Workspace, in your Microsoft Copilot world, logged into your work account, it is not that different than having that data set sitting on your SharePoint, okay?    So, there may be other ethical reasons, and we will definitely spend more time exploring those next week, while you might say, no, no, no, we don't want to do it that way, or we want to have certain validation checks.  
  03:01:50 \- Classroom 520  
      But if you're using a tool like Claude or ChatGPT, then...    that we do have a lot of information from Dataverse, Social Security, address, parent name, anything like that.    I think that that's one of the concerns, you know, about the privacy of the data.    You know, I don't know if everyone here does assign their clients, you know, application number.    So I'm thinking like, oh, maybe we can, you know, for anything that we're using AI, instead of referring to identity banks by their name, maybe just use their application number and, you know, or any personal information, you know, and then we can type, like, participant 3, 2, 1, then we can call to the internal database and say, that belongs to this participant.    Yeah.    So that's the way, that's a translation table.    You can even have a makeup number.    That's a translation table.    That's, um, pseudonymism, oh, God, I'm not gonna be able to say it.    It's autonomization, yeah, it's a form of words.    I'm so done.    was to say pseudonymization.    So that's different from anonymization because you can still track the same identity across different data sets, but you need it as pseudonymous identity.    So it's not any person that's identified as a real person, but I know this person in this data set is the same person as another data set.    So that's pseudonymization, which is usually what you actually want to do, not anonymization.    But as Kim said, AI is pretty good at figuring out who they are anyway, so it's a tricky thing.    Kim and I live in data privacy and cybersecurity, but our background prior to the last three years is the previous 10 to that.    Both of us were doing data privacy and cybersecurity almost exclusively.    So this is the area I know probably better than anything else.    And the thing that I tell all our clients is that the absolute best thing that you can do, because it's easy for staff to understand, is say that the data that is in our tool.    So if we are...    Using Microsoft 365, data that is already in Microsoft 365 is fine to use with Copilot, because Microsoft's data privacy policy is very clear.    It's not exposing it to anything that it's not already exposed to by being there in the first place.    And that's generally, staff can understand that.    Don't take it out of 365, period.    If you're in Google Workspace, but it's already in Google Drive, and you have access to it, go ahead and use it.    Knock yourself out with Gemini, but don't take it outside of Google for any other tool.    That is the easiest security and data privacy to be effective within an organization have to be understood and practiced by staff.    And staff, very, very consistently, all of you have probably done this, work around organizational systems to solve problems for yourself.    I can't get this report in Salesforce, so I'm going to download all of our clients, all of    donor data to my personal laptop and put it in Excel and use some work on it.    You just broke about 9 million data privacy, but it happens all the time.    If I swim, I do, I literally have to handle my laptop.    It's going to be easier to just, hey, you know what, keep it.    Yeah, so simple, clear so they can understand, but allows them to do the work they want to do.    That is how cybersecurity and data privacy work in organizations.    If you think you can just block everything and say, no, you can't trust me, I know.    So, sorry, Kim, now, oh, I wanted to say a couple other things on exploratory data, coming back to this.    Number one, I first discovered this from a class I took from Tina, the one I can recommend probably two years ago.    This has been one of the most revelatory, like, unlocks for me, because to me, it basically felt like I now have a team of data scientists just at my beck and call, where I can just say, go tell me about this data.    Go make data visualization.    make data visualization.    Figure out this correlation for me.    Do that for me.    And the only limit is my ability to understand what kind of visualizations I need, what kind of insights I want, data terminology, things like that.    And I can learn enough about that to be really helpful.    So it is an unbelievable utility to learn how to do.    I think many of you will find this.    If you haven't done this already, this will be one of the most exciting parts of this course for you, is this ability.    Many of you, hopefully, are thinking, huh, the validation part.    That's hard.    Like, I get it if I only have, like, 300 records.    I can kind of eyeball and say, did it tell me there are 900 records?    And I know that that's wrong.    But if it's, like, a 10,000 record data set or a 100,000 record data set, and I don't understand the data very well, how am I supposed to validate it?    So I have a strategy for this that's been pretty effective.    I'm curious if anyone has an idea of how you can do this without having to be this.    The Data Scientist yourself, yeah.  
  03:08:01 \- Kim Snyder  
      Could you ask two different systems to do it and see if there's differences?    Or the same system to do it with a different session.    So we have an exploratory data prompt.    I haven't shared it because we're trying to go one thing at a time, but I have a validation prompt that I say, here is a data set, and here are data visualizations, insights, and a report that was created from this data set.  
  03:08:27 \- Classroom 520  
      Please look at these and validate that the data in the report accurately reflects the data in the data set.    Do this according to scientific principles and blah, blah, blah.    I created that using the Metaprompt tool and saying this is what I need you to do.    It made the prompt.    I tested it, and that works really well, and I don't have to be a data scientist to do it.    It takes a little while because I have to do my report, make sure that works, then do the validation.    But that saves me from going in front of a client and presenting a report and them saying, that makes no sense at all.    Which is very embarrassing.    There are horrible moments that you want to avoid.    If we can help you avoid those, we will.    Yeah, and one thing, this is from doing this a fair amount, sometimes it'll start to go sideways.    Like, it'll make the same mistake, and it just keeps making it over and over again, or it just doesn't seem to get it.    When that happens, start a new session.    I describe this as the quick brown fox problem.    So, if I say the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy, everybody in the room, or at least everybody of a certain age, is thinking dog.    Okay, and it's going to be very hard to get you to not think dog from that point forward, because the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog, right?  
  03:09:42 \- Kim Snyder  
      And so, that session is going to just have that stuck in the AI's head forever.    I'm never going to get it to not think dog.    I just need to start a new session that doesn't have the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy in the beginning of it.    So, Aaron, and and then...    then...    Oh, I have your name, Luann.    Okay, Aaron.    You start a session on ChatGPT.  
  03:10:04 \- Classroom 520  
      Is that a new chat?    Yeah.    Yeah.    You just start a brand new chat.  
  03:10:07 \- Kim Snyder  
      Yes, Luann.    That's incredibly helpful because I've gotten stuck before not knowing what to do, so I just stopped using AI.  
  03:10:14 \- Classroom 520  
      I got in fight with it because it kept saying, I just did this, and I'd be like, no, you didn't.    You remember the Tanmay video we showed you last week with the showing that the next word that it's going to pick?    I think of that being the quick front box jump over the lazy, and that has helped me so much.  
  03:10:37 \- Kim Snyder  
      I just say to myself, oh, I'm in a quick front box problem.  
  03:10:39 \- Classroom 520  
      Like, I've just got to start over because it's got it stuck.  
  03:10:43 \- Kim Snyder  
      I have the funniest story about that, okay?  
  03:10:46 \- Classroom 520  
      And then we'll go back.    But, you know, in our office hours, right, this is an AI generated four o'clock, right?    Because that's when they are.    Looks like.    like.    AI could not tell time.    I had to fake that in Canva.    It would not stop giving me, like, 10 after 10\.    Right?    And the more I asked it, it was like, no, you know, like, 4 o'clock.    No, 4 o'clock.    Come on.    It's a funny thread.    I don't remember who it was, but someone asked to make, like, the most boring image from, like, Dali or Jachimiti or one of these movie makers and make me the most boring thing.    And then it kept saying, no, more boring, more boring, more boring.    Horrific, nightmarish, like, thing that got boring, more complex and crazy over time.    Every time it's a boring, you know what mean?    No, not boring, it's a boring, anyway.    So, I think the next thing is, so this is, um...    Hang on, Aaron had a question, but quick, Aaron.  
  03:11:49 \- Kim Snyder  
      Yeah, go ahead.    Yeah, feel free to put this on a parking lot.  
  03:11:52 \- Classroom 520  
      Sometimes AI tells me, is there a lot different things that it's going to work to do?  
  03:11:57 \- Kim Snyder  
      How do I distinguish when that's true or not?  
  03:11:59 \- Classroom 520  
      okay.    you.    Thank    Well, there you learn.    Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  03:12:02 \- Kim Snyder  
      It's so frustrating.    Yeah, a lot of times you get in this thing where, like, they make me an audiophile of this.    Okay, I'm starting.    And it's, like, doing nothing.    You're like, okay, I'll be ready in minute.    You're not doing anything.    Yeah, you just have to kind of learn, like, and just say, oh, okay, obviously you can't do that.    It's frustrating.    a human.  
  03:12:22 \- Classroom 520  
      Yeah.    They're people pleasers first, and practical second.    Yeah.    Sometimes, sometimes really frustrating people pleasers.    Like, over-promise and maybe deliver.  
  03:12:35 \- Kim Snyder  
      Yes.  
  03:12:36 \- Classroom 520  
      The problem I always bring up about is inability to make slide decks.  
  03:12:41 \- Kim Snyder  
      You know, like, like, use this format, use this, you know, use this font, and it's like, yeah, I got it.  
  03:12:47 \- Classroom 520  
      And then, no.    It would give you more Claude Envy reason, but I won't.  
  03:12:52 \- Kim Snyder  
      But I know you, and you've also mentioned Claude and Gamma.    Yeah.    Yeah, was really good.    Yeah, Canada is also pretty good.    All got a cruise.  
  03:13:03 \- Classroom 520  
      I want to give everybody EDA time.    Publicly available data for now.    We just had that conversation.    So a note on data analysis.    So you can see all four of them do this.  
  03:13:15 \- Kim Snyder  
      But just note that they change and they get better all the time.  
  03:13:18 \- Classroom 520  
      So what we have is the exploratory.    Oh, I just have the data set.    And then we have to give you the prompt.    How do work on the prompt, Kim, while you get the data set?    Give everybody to download the data set and I will work on the prompt.    Yeah, download.    a one, Kim?    Huh?    So this is the prompt that I have.    It's in the community.    Yeah, I'll go to the community.    That's fine.    And I can make the tiny URL.    So you do this on this screen.    Folks, download the data.  
  03:13:57 \- Kim Snyder  
      I'm going to give you the prompt in a second.    I have a tiny URL.    Where can we find it in the community?  
  03:14:05 \- Classroom 520  
      In Session 2 Resources, I believe.    Yes.    Although I don't see it there yet.    Yeah, I don't see Session 2 Resources.    You don't see it at all?    I don't see it in Session 2 Resources at UVA Prom.    I see it in but I don't see in Session Resources, so if you want the prompt, just about to put the tiny URL.    Okay.    Not bad.    bad.    working on it.    So So it's tiny URL.    So what you're going to do is download the Titanic data set.    I recommend you download it as a CSV file.    For those of you that are unfamiliar with different data formats, CSV stands for, not that anyone cares, comma-separated variable.    It's basically a plain text file that just separates the values with commas and then has hard returns for the different records, okay?    So it's a data format that's simple and easy for these large language models to understand.    If you download it as Excel, that's fine.    It will probably work.    But in my experience, the large language models will make errors more often with Excel files because they're a more complicated format.    They first have to kind of figure out, oh, this is an Excel file.    I need to go figure out how to read    Whereas the CSVs, they're like, oh, this is like my language.    I totally get it.    So I recommend a CSV, okay?    Just download that so you have it on your computer.    Go to your large language model.    So again, that's StadGBT or Claude or Gemini or Copilot of your choice.    Copy the EDA prompt.  
  03:16:22 \- Kim Snyder  
      Paste it into the chat.  
  03:16:25 \- Classroom 520  
      Upload the CSV.    Hit go.    And then start interacting, okay?    It's going to run for a while, but it'll probably ask you questions and give you outputs.    You're all going to get different outputs, even people that are using the same LLM, because again, we're probabilistic technology.    And so direct it to the things that you are interested in in this data set.    And what I want to be able to do is we'll do a show and tell so that people who get reports...    reports and data visualizations from this Titanic dataset, let's share them with each other and see what we learn.    If you want to use a different public dataset, that's fine.  
  03:17:12 \- Kim Snyder  
      If you want to use your own organization's data, I am not responsible for that.  
  03:17:19 \- Classroom 520  
      You do that at your own risk.    All right.    right.    Yeah.    And now these things should be visible also- Whatever large language model you use.    What are you using?    ChatGPT or Gemini or- But we're not using a special program within that.    We're just uploading it.    Just you're pasting the prompt into the chat box, into the session, and then you're uploading the CSV file.    Would people like me to demonstrate this in the browser?    Yeah.    Okay.    Cam, can you demonstrate doing this in ChatGPT and Compilot?  
  03:17:52 \- Kim Snyder  
      Yes.    Just so they can see exactly what they're supposed to do?  
  03:17:55 \- Classroom 520  
      So you're gonna copy this- And then copy this- The whole thing.    The whole whole thing.    The whole thing.    The whole thing.    Then I'm going to go control A, control C, command A, command C for Apple folks.    Right.    You're pacing the whole thing right here.    Okay, let me just get my Titanic data.    I have penguins.    Oh, the tiny URL for the prompt?    I will re-pitch you because she's got something else up on the screen right now.  
  03:18:30 \- Kim Snyder  
      Could it be added as an announcement to this meeting?  
  03:18:32 \- Classroom 520  
      It is tinyurl.com.    Here's the tiny URL prompt.    Slash EDA-prompt.    I'm just going to take a Yeah, no problem.    It's tinyurl.com slash EDA-prompt.    Okay.    So here I am.    Should I show?    Oh, so you do not have    to have extended thinking on.    In fact, I recommend you turn that off for now.    So if you're using chat CBT, recommend leaving it on auto and leaving extended thinking off.    Okay, so I'm going to paste in that long prompt.    So does everyone have it?    can show a demo.    Thank you.    And Ariana just added the prompt in the announcements as opposed.    Thank you.    Correct.    You're going to upload the CSV file as an attachment to the session and then paste the entire prompt right into the box.    Okay.    So Kim's going to now hit the plus sign and add the CSV file.    to have extended thinking on.    In fact, I recommend you turn that off for now.    So if you're using chat CBT, recommend leaving it on auto and leaving extended thinking off.    Okay, so I'm going to paste in that long prompt.    So does everyone have it?    can show a demo.    Thank you.    And Ariana just added the prompt in the announcements as opposed.    Thank you.    Correct.    You're going to upload the CSV file as an attachment to the session and then paste the entire prompt right into the box.    Okay.    So Kim's going to now hit the plus sign and add the CSV file.    File as an attachment, okay?    See what she's doing?    So add photos and files, choose the Titanic passenger list, and then hit go.    I really, really want everybody to try this on their own system if you possibly can.    So this is a place where I'm happy to come around and help you.    This is literally the last thing we're doing today, so I want everybody to have a shot at this.    Yeah, it's not the reason we're looking at this, so...    Yeah, it's    Okay, so now you want to like interact with them, tell them to see what's going on, this data visualization, what's Are you interested in telling your types of data?    you.    Okay, ask it, like, what are you interested in?    In this type of data, like, past the data, you can address the data, you can address the question, like, how much more likely would someone to survive?    You can ask basic questions.    What likely was a child who survived?    What was the most more likely factor?    What was most determined factor about someone who survived?    What are you curious about?    Well, you could say, like, what's the car length most?    Like, what factor will car length most?    You know, like, it might say, like, oh, they were older or something.    You know, it could be, you know, based on the data, it's going to see what pulls out.    Yeah, I got this.    I got this.    Yeah, you got that one.    But the other one.    Put it in.    Yeah, because when I got it in, put it in.    Oh, seriously.    We need the, we need the, um.    Yeah.    Thanks.    We're out.    We're out.    We're out.    Yeah.    Yeah.    Open another.    All right, anybody struggling?    Anyone need help?    Yeah, it's over here.    Yes.    We're together.    Okay.    We've got the data.    Yeah.    Oh, the prompt, because, yeah, you don't want to copy the URL of the prompt, you want to copy, yeah, yeah.    So, if you want to download that, I don't know you can see a download option for this.    Oh, got the...    Oh, you're in copal.    Okay, great.    Okay.    So, let's go into...    Great.    So, go into...    But even if it's pretty close again, that's where you can get this.    Okay.    then we're gonna...    Oh, this is slash PDA.    I...    I'll see.    I'll I'll see.    Bye-bye.    Watch you.-bye.    time.    Now we're to your co-pilot.    You're actually in it.    It's in itself.    Yeah.    You're going to use co-pilot directly.    So go to here.    And upload the data set.    Enlarging that is the same thing.    I'm going to try to download this.    Why don't I see, like, Excel options.    Well, first of all, first first first all, all, all, all, all, all, first first first of Thank    Oh, really?    So it doesn't give you, like, download options?    That doesn't really let you download it.    Do you have Excel?    Can you go into Excel?    Well, I do want you to be able to do it.    I'm just trying to figure out how to do We other apps.    I don't know.    I don't know.    don't You don't have to sign it.    You're on the receipt.    Yeah.    I just wanted to go on.    I'm We signed you on Microsoft 365, I think.    Yeah.    I'm glad you are there.    You are signed up.    Yeah, yeah.    I'm in there.    I'm in I didn't realize.    M365.    Yeah.    Okay.    Yeah.    Oh, yeah.    we go.    Yeah.    one.    it.    Now we go to Excel.    I'm actually going to create a blank.    Let's see if it's working.    that's what I'm thinking about.    Yeah.    if I'm adding a page.    one.    Eten's an option.    I don't know why I think about the technique like it's going Yay.    Okay.    Oh, yeah, well, got, I got the, I didn't get the desk.    There we go, okay, now we can export that, that's CSV, we have a prompt here, control C, oh my god, we're going to get there, I'm so excited.    So I'm going to upload images of your files, where did this download go?    All right.    Yeah, this is you.    Where is it?    I know, I saw you copy and paste of me what it is.    Where did you go?    It's on a computer.    It's been directed since it was.    It's a media, what's that?    I think it's here, this is for a lot of media.    And .    All right, all right.    Thank you.    guys.    So what is, I got this, I mean.    Yeah, what you wanted to do is download that as a CSV file.    So go to file and download a CSV.    No, the file menu.    Go back on, yeah.    And go to the file menu and download file, right?    The word file.    Oh, yeah.    And download as CSV.    There you go.    Right here.    Yep.    Now, do you have the prompt?    No, I don't have the prompt.    That's what I was going to do.    That's bad.    Takeover?    Yeah, I the EDA.    I got the prompt.    I'm going to put it.    So, I need...    Oh.    I'll show you a moment.    Yeah.    We're going to copy this.    We're in Copilot.    We're going to make a new chat.    We're going to fix that.    Right there.    We're going to upload.    We've got a chat.    We're going to upload.    And as soon as it's finished, uploading.    Boom.    We did it.    Yay.    Okay.    All right.    So you can work with him.    Okay.    All right.    All right.    All right.    I'm going give everybody a challenge with this data set.    And let's see if you can find the answer.    Okay.    For those of you who have this working, I'd like you to give me the answer to this question.    Okay.    Okay.    How many children under the age of 16 survive the Titanic?    How many children?    And I'd like.    Tell me out of how many children total, okay?    So out of the total number of children on the Titanic, how many under the age of 16 survived?    What was your percentage chance of survival if were under the age of 16 and on the Titanic?    Don't you have to define children?    Under the age of 16\.    Okay.    And let's see if we all get the same number.    I got the total number of children under 18 is 113\.    Under 18\.    I'm looking for under 16\.    no.    the total of 18 and then for the under 16 children under the age of 16 and under 16\.    Wait, Hang on.    Hang on.    So first, what do we have is the total number of children under the age of 16 that were on the Titanic?    83\.    83\.    83\.    83\.    83\.    Out of 83 children, how many survived?    49\.    49\.    Okay.    I've got the same answer.    That's good.    No.    I have 52\.    What did you ask?    What did you ask?    I think you probably did 18\.    I got 49 children.    How many children in the 60s about this?    And it says, I don't know.    Interesting.    Everybody else got 49\.    Change is going to choose the passengers.    Yeah, tell them passengers on their 60s.    Okay.    Start a new chat.    All right.    Anyone have any insights or data visualizations they would like to share that they got from the data set?    Yes.    Yeah.    When it suggested things it could do, I took one of its suggestions, which was drilling to family effects to see whether traveling with family helped to hurt survival odds.    Love this question.    Excellent.    And it said it had visuals for me to download, but then when I clicked the link, it took me to kind of like an error message and a haiku.    many many of 90s?    you.    Yeah, probably mistake.    I mean, what I would always say is, can you please remake the visual for me?    It doesn't seem to be working.    Can you remake it?    should the visual appear?    Like, is it downloadable?    It depends.    What platform you're using?    ChatGPT.    It should show up in the session.    You should be able to see it.    Or if it downloads, it should be usually a PNG image.    It says download PNG.    Yeah.    When I click PNG, it says open link, and that's when I get the error.    So maybe I should be copying the link?    Uh, I don't know, unfortunately.    I'm sorry.    These are just image files.    So in theory, when open in any image editor you have, like Windows Preview or your browser, this depends on what you have set as your default image viewer.    You've had something you want to say?    No.    Okay.    Yes, or I'll take it.    So I tried it at Home, Co-Pilot, Gemini, Claw, H, as you can see.    Awesome.    Okay.    Thank you, y'all have a lady, too.    I like Father.    That's the user interface and even interactive where you can check on the categories and so Oh, do you want to listen to what calls it can answer it, I can it, I can answer it, can answer it, can answer Yeah, no, for real.    Like, it's so interactive, like, you can just share.    Yeah.    Do you want to join the zoo and share?    Or would you rather not do that?    I mean, I can do that, that's fine.    Is it on my account?    Just download the data.    There's a share code.    Hang on.    No, I got the answer.    The sharing key is JSSFLH, so if you just...    What happened to you computer?    80% of my issues...    yeah.    80% of my issues...  
  03:34:50 \- Kim Snyder  
      The 20% is...    computer itself...  
  03:34:55 \- Classroom 520  
      you hit share...    I see it, and you want to go back...  
  03:34:59 \- Kim Snyder  
      Luke, guess, for sure to...    What kind of is A computer?    Yeah.  
  03:35:03 \- Classroom 520  
      But I think it's the network.    A network that just takes it.    So, I'm a different response.    turn.    J-S-S-F-L-H.    J-S-S-F J-U-S-H-D-S.    J-U-S-H-D-S.    There we go.    That's fine.    Um, so this is what this looks like on Coya, right?    So, yeah, this is going to give you a nice interactive feel.    You'd be even like.    Click on it during the categories, gender, class, age, it makes it so much easier, honestly, I feel like it's something that you can also share, you know, that is real.    Yeah, by the way, something that you want to show someone, something that also lets you do, which is, so in the upper right, you have a publish option, and it says artifact, and that actually makes it available publicly.    So that becomes a URL, you could share that in the community, and then everybody would be able to see and interact with this dashboard that Carlton just made, which is a unique function of a client.  
  03:36:42 \- Kim Snyder  
      You're basically building a website.  
  03:36:45 \- Classroom 520  
      I don't know how to share it with you yet, but I've got the page there.  
  03:36:49 \- Kim Snyder  
      All right.    Announcement.  
  03:36:50 \- Classroom 520  
      Just do an announcement.  
  03:36:51 \- Kim Snyder  
      Announcement.    First update.  
  03:36:54 \- Classroom 520  
      Go to update.    You can stop sharing it now.    Thank you, Carlton.    Do you want to show us?    Yeah, go ahead.  
  03:37:03 \- Kim Snyder  
      Carlton's going to show us what he did on other platforms.    Now, Google Gemini shows it.    They went by Survival by Passionary, Transgender, Agents of B-Sham, from Survivors and Non-Survivors, and they broke it down this way.    Quiet back in here, sir.    So this is how it looks on Gemini, Copilot, real quick, M365.    It's kind of plain, but I give you some stuff right here.    As you can see, it even gives you that overview of the age, means, and failures, correlations.    That's how it looks here in ChatGPT, right?  
  03:37:41 \- Classroom 520  
      Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.    That's okay.  
  03:37:43 \- Kim Snyder  
      That's okay.    And if anyone is having, like, major cloud envy, which I was afraid of, there's a phrase in data science that is the data, you know, sometimes we have bad data, or we, you know, I send out a survey, and I had 50 people that I sent it out to, but I only got six responses.    So    The phrases, if any of you ever heard this, the data you have is better than the data you don't have, right?    And so same thing about these models.    The data visualization tool you have is better than the one you don't have.    So if you don't have a clause, it's okay.    You still just got some amazing capabilities today in the platform you have.    And if you really need these more sophisticated ones, then, of course, you can make that business case, okay?    Carlton, you're awesome.    Thank you.    I much appreciate that.    If anyone else want to share anything that they have from their screen, again, could be Zoom things.    so easy.    can pop up if you want to be brave like Carlton.    No one else.    Yeah.    No one else.    All right.    That's cool.    All right.    Now, we do have a few other things if you're...    Yeah, we should probably get to them, Tim, because we're kind of close on time.    So why don't you take back over?    Take us home.    I will take us home.    And hopefully I'll be able to fly home tomorrow.    I think you should try.    All right.    All right.    So remember, data privacy is my thing, right?    So, but also data privacy, but also the kind of governance and verification.    As we have just seen, it is so easy.    I went ahead too fast.    It is so easy to, um, create beautiful, pen is, uh, not being my friend this month.    I can just see your pen, Kim.    Where do you want me to point?    No, so here's the thing.    You a pen?    Yeah.    No, she wants to go back, but he's not allowing it.    Yeah, it's not, but forget it.    Um, but I can use the pen now.    Actually, this is a perfect time to use the pen.    All right.    So remember how last week we were talking about like, and we'll talk about it more next week when we think about responsible AI, but vetting the output of the AI, like reviewing it, human in the loop, human augmentation, know, stuff you don't want to just send out there, right?    So that I would call in the easy section, low complexity.    The review rigor, and I mean rigor means like how hard is it to do, is not that hard because you review it.    And if it's something you're not sure, you can send it to a colleague who knows the answer, right?    Like, can you review this for me if someone's an expert in something that you're not?    All right.    So that's pretty straightforward.    As we start to go up the, I'll call it the complexity continuum, right?    Analysis.    So the data stuff that we just did was more complex.    There's more going on in these systems.    The review rigor also goes up.    Right?    And as Josh said earlier, he made, you know, kind of a point to say, you don't want to get in front of, like, you know, a board member with the chart and they say, like, well, wait a minute, but I thought we only had, like, 12 of these programs, and why does your data visualization say we have 18?    Right?    So it is so, and it will, stuff like that will happen.    So it's so important.    And, you know, I have stepped in it with AI like that.    Okay?    Like, the chart just looks so perfect.    And it's not a good moment.    Right?    And I'll say, like, next week, we're going to talk more about some automation stuff.    That's where it even gets harder to review.    But they know that the rigor of the review.    Now, Josh also described kind of a prompt that can validate, right?    So again, it's, you know, and I would still probably...  
  03:42:00 \- Classroom 520  
      Eyeball a few things, even with that, right?  
  03:42:03 \- Kim Snyder  
      The human in the loop.    It's all right.    So you go away.    So I just wanted to point that out.    Oops, I've got to get rid of these.    Let's clear.    All drawings.    Oh, okay.    So this is the zone we're talking about here, right?    It's just more complex.    And know that that, you know, that's a continuum.    It gets, you know, harder to do a little bit.    And then the last part of this, we're kind of wrapping up today to say, all right, so how does the compass, so, you know, we talked about a framework that we use for applying AI and working with AI intentionally, right?    So how does this relate to the stuff we talked about today, right?    And, you know, what we have walked through    Drew, when we talk about the middle part of Compass, right, method, all right, we have talked about a bunch of new methods, a bunch of new ways you can work.    So your toolbox, hopefully, feels a little more full than when you came in this morning.    So these are new ways you can work with AI, whether it's the packages that we showed in the beginning, the deeper analysis like notebook or notebook and copilot, and these various, you know, approaches here with the, this should say EDA.    But, okay, so that's the method.    So you have some new methods.    So you have some new tools in your toolbox, the performance.    So you do it.    And that's why it was really important that you went ahead and did this, even if it felt like, oh, I'm not sure if I got it.    And we are always happy to put videos.    Because if anyone's like, I can sometimes get back home and be like, wait, what did I do?    Right?    So we are happy to supplement that community with videos.    Just, you know, in fact, they'll probably drop in there.    But if you need like a hand, you can always ask for like, how on earth did you do that?    It makes no sense to me.    And this is the space to do that in.    It's fine.    Right?    And other people are thinking that same thing, too, if you are.    So know that that's okay.    But use this stuff.    Try to find places to use this and to try out these things, whether it's the packages or the exploratory data analysis.    And see what works.    Right?    That's how you're going to, that's, like, that's the best way to learn AI.    People ask me, like, what's the best process for learning AI?  
  03:44:55 \- Classroom 520  
      Practicing.    All right.    And then the assessment.    And that's what you can see, like today, there's a lot of assessment to be done in terms of the outputs, especially when you're doing stuff around data analysis.  
  03:45:08 \- Kim Snyder  
      So these are the things, you know, you're assessing how did it work, but you're also assessing your processes.  
  03:45:14 \- Classroom 520  
      As you start to think about, you we did that workflow task way in the beginning, you know, you will try out different things and different ways to incorporate AI into your workflows.    And then, did this work?    Did it help?    Did it take longer?    Josh and I will show you next week vibe coding.    For a little while, we were like, vibe coding slides, because it was like so easy and so cool.    You know what?    Don't ever like have to do a PDF printout of those slides, because that'll be the next six hours of your life, right?    So we learned lessons, like this is, okay, this is not a good use case, even though it seemed like it might be initially.    And I continue.    I to, you know, revise and, and, and.    And that's that part.    It's important to assess because these are new ways of working.    There'll be new ways of working for you and the people you're working with.    Not all of it's going to work, but a lot of it can, right?    And think of it also as continuous improvement because I often find ways I can do things better, right?    Like, so Josh's validation prompt probably came out of having had the experience of, like, oy, right?    Ugh, I have this data.    It'd be impossible to validate.    And I have to make sure it's okay so I'm not standing there, like, how am I?    Right?    So these, some things are born out of necessity and just continuous review.    And bringing it back, I'd say, like, make a, make a, I mean, try all of it, but make an AI package and share it with someone in your organization who's not in, in this, in the room with you today.    Yeah, but if you, um, refresh and go back, uh, a couple slides.    I added something.    It's slide 58 now.    Sorry.    can screen share if you want.    No worries.    58?    Yeah.    So, in speaking of sharing something, I was actually checking to see if this was still up because I made this back in a roundtable.    So, when I, we've mentioned this, Tina Wong is like one of the people we follow.    She runs a program called Only Octopus, and I took a fairly comprehensive course on data science and AI from her.    She was a data scientist of meta, and went off on her own, and now does stuff.  
  03:47:37 \- Kim Snyder  
      She does great content.    Anyway, the project I built for that, you had to, it's very project-based learning, so you had to build stuff, was this zombie apocalypse readiness check.    So, much like we looked at the Titanic data today, I did a number of different deep research projects to try to figure out what, from different zombie narratives.  
  03:47:59 \- Classroom 520  
      So, Sean.    of the Dead, Walking Dead, you know, different books and movies and narratives, video games, Last of Us, those kinds of things, and tried to quantify what are the qualities that allow someone to survive a zombie apocalypse.    And then based on that data set, I made a chatbot that does two things.    Tells you how likely you are to survive a zombie apocalypse, and also tells you who you should partner up with based on your skill set.    One of the interesting things about it was that some of the things were pretty intuitive, like, of course, physical fitness and your ability, your knowledge of weapons and survival skills matter, but they weren't the most critical criteria.    yeah.    The most common criteria in zombie apocalypse was, number one, basically attitude.    Like, it had to do with maintaining an upbeat attitude, keeping morale up, being able to sort of, like, just want to continue to survive and sort of have some level of enjoyment in survival.    I think that seemed to be the number one quality.    Number two was sort of your ability to work with other people, like, because you had to be working with other people.    And then it was some of the fitness and survival things.    It also is fun because you can, like, have it say, like, I'm a cat, and then it will talk to you like you're a cat, which is pretty fun.    Anyway, so you can go ahead and do that, and it'll tell you who you – anyway, fun.    So that was, like, an example of a fun data science project to build a little AI application that you can share with people.    This doesn't require any coding.    We've taught you all the skills you would need to build something like this for yourself in the first few sessions.  
  03:49:37 \- Kim Snyder  
      Thanks, Kim.    Sorry about that.  
  03:49:39 \- Classroom 520  
      No worries.  
  03:49:41 \- Kim Snyder  
      And I'm glad it's still up because Roundtable hasn't taken my account off on it, obviously.    Wow, your account is still – Yeah.    Interesting.    All right.    So, yeah, so do one of these.  
  03:49:53 \- Classroom 520  
      And one of these – so Justin has a feedback form.    Yes, very quick.    It's    It's two minutes.    It's like what I shared with you after the first session via email.    And, yeah, take this back.    Share it.    Oh, and we wanted to get a group photo.    There's an amazing, this building has one of the rarest views.    Ariana, who's our kind host, told us this, we can see all the way up to Harlem, up this avenue here.    And there's a conference room over here that has a giant floor-to-ceiling window.    So, we actually wanted to just try to get a group photo with everybody real quick before we all leave.    So, if everybody is willing to do that before we pack up and move out, if we can all just go down to that conference room, we're going to try to get a group photo with everybody.    All right?    And if you just refuse to be in a group photo, then be a party pooper, fine.    You'll be the first to go in the zombie apocalypse.    Kim, we're going to have to Photoshop you in.    like, how are you going to do that?    You can AI hurry now, right?    I got 83\.    83?    You're...    Ready to Survive.    Who should you partner with?    It says that I'm, you know, me, the strategy survivor, I I have to find a home, especially, because I can have five.    I need a medic, a healer, an engineer, and a murabu healer.    There you go.    That's what it's making for my wife and I.    I should maintain a zombie apocalypse team.    All right, everybody, let's go to the conference room real quick.    Let's get a great room.    See you in person next week.    Bye.    He's gone.    Okay, he's gone?    right.    Ciao.    Well, just put the picture for the moment.    We're going to be there.    See you next week.    Bye.    Bye.    Bye.    Bye.    Bye.    Bye.    Bye.    Bye.    Bye.    Bye.    Yeah, the last book, hold up, though.    I'll take this.    Sorry, do have any?    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.    sir.    I feel like that's why you can tell it to protect yourself.    Oh, yeah.    Oh, That's for the song, Yes.    not.    I'm not.    It's just my survival order.    Yeah.    Oh, yeah.    If they're, like, getting busy.    If they get busy.    Yes.    Leave.    But if I just, like, Yeah, gotta waste your boots.    No, Right.    Whatever.    day you gotta back to the area.    Well, if there's a player, and then we can't operate from the different cure-up for zombies, you have to operate in survival mode.    And the people who don't have to do that.    We didn't seem to know.    Yes, thank god.    waiting for that.    Let's wait for hours.    Yeah.    My tattoo is here.    Come on, let's go.    want to play?    Let's take fun?    Let's do this.    I need to get it.    Especially the babies, the babies are going to be crying.    don't know where we're at.    that's the problem.    That's why I was like, man.    You told me why you told me the kids.    surprises.    didn't have babies.    What do do?    That's the scariest thing.    know what they did?    Dealing with babies and old people.    do what they want to I told my parents.    And special needs people.    It's a room for y'all.    Like, they do what they want to do.    That's you.    They're Puerto Rican, they know how use a knife.    Hiding the probability of survival.    So we Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.    And hopefully we get to do more and more of this kind of stuff.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank Thank you.    Any other markers?    No, I see a red one right there next to your question.    On your table?    No, you.    Amber, are you still here?    She left.    Okay.    We ran off.
