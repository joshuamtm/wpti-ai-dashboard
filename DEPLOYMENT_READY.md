## 💬 Rollout Communication

### To Your Team:
> "We've added a Research Context page that explains why Wharton found 75% success while MIT found 95% failure—and how WPTI's approach is aligned with what actually works. It positions our program within the latest research and gives participants ammunition for budget requests."

### To Participants:
> "Check out the new Research tab! It shows how the two biggest AI adoption studies of 2025 validate what you're experiencing: high personal usage (87%) but low organizational adoption (22.7%). The next sessions bridge this 'AI Divide.'"

### To Funders:
> "Our dashboard now includes research context from 800 enterprises (Wharton) and 300+ implementations (MIT). It validates our 1,756% ROI and explains why our approach—measuring productivity, buying not building, and democratizing fluency—succeeds where 95% of projects fail."
